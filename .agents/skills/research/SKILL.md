description: Research workflow for distilling ML/AI papers into modelless inference primitives, freeze/thaw runtime patterns, and latent-space operations across the katgpt-rs / riir-ai / riir-chain / riir-train repo quartet. Use when reading arxiv papers, deciding which repo a paper belongs in, creating .research/ notes or .plans/ files, implementing modelless inference primitives, or routing training-vs-inference insights. Enforces the 4-repo commercial strategy (public engine / private runtime / private chain / private training), modelless-first constraint, latent-to-latent preference, and freeze/thaw-over-fine-tuning rule.

# Research Workflow — Modelless Inference, Freeze/Thaw, Latent-to-Latent

Training-method research lives in `riir-train`. This repo (`katgpt-rs`), `riir-ai` (freeze/thaw runtime + self-learn/adaptive NPCs + game systems), and `riir-chain` (neuro-symbolic chain transport, LatCal, neuron_db, chain economics) ship **runtime + latent-space operations**. No LoRA training, no adapter fine-tuning, no optimizer research here. If a paper's value is its training loop → `riir-train/.research`. If its value is a latent-space insight, a routing trick, a freeze/thaw pattern, a chain-commitment bridge, or a modelless inference primitive → distill here.

## When to use this skill

Activate when the user (or you) are doing any of:

- Reading / fetching / summarizing an ML, AI, or systems paper (arxiv, PDF, blog).
- Deciding which of the 4 repos a paper or idea belongs in (katgpt-rs / riir-ai / riir-chain / riir-train).
- Creating a new `.research/NNN_*.md` note or `.plans/NNN_*.md` plan.
- Implementing a modelless inference primitive (pruner, bandit, router, speculative decode, KV-cache op, sparse attention, quantization-aware inference).
- Designing freeze/thaw snapshot cycles, adapter hot-swap, or runtime adapter routing.
- Designing latent-to-latent operations (dot-product projection, sigmoid gating, manifold geometry, spectral methods on activations).
- Designing MMORPG-scale game AI (thousands of concurrent NPCs, 20Hz tick, fog-of-war, zone attention, emergent social/economic behavior).

Do NOT activate for: pure refactor tasks, bug fixes with no research angle, or ordinary feature work that doesn't touch the research/plans folders.

## Repos (siblings under the same parent)

- `katgpt-rs/` — public MIT engine. Generic modelless inference primitives. **No game IP, no chain IP.**
- `riir-ai/` — private game product. Freeze/thaw runtime, self-learn, game systems. **Chain was spun off to `riir-chain/` (see `.plans/001_chain_spinoff.md` in that repo).**
- `riir-chain/` — private neuro-symbolic chain transport. LatCal (Lattice Calculus), `neuron_db`, `riir-chaind` daemon, chain economics, Solana-parity features, asset lifecycle / forensic fingerprinting. **The sync-boundary bridge repo.**
- `riir-train/` — private training vault. Adapter training, optimizers, loss functions. Out of scope for this workflow — just note "→ riir-train" and stop.

(`riir-armageddon/` is a fifth sibling — arena/game-product domain types only, not a distillation target. Read its README for the raw-vs-latent boundary; do not distill into it.)

Always reference files with project-relative paths (e.g. `katgpt-rs/.research/238_*.md`, `riir-ai/.plans/NNN_*.md`, `riir-chain/.plans/NNN_*.md`). The agent can `read_file` these directly.

## Read first (grounding) — MANDATORY pre-flight

**Hard rule:** before any distillation, verdict, or file creation, you MUST do **both** of these in this session:

1. **`read_file` all four READMEs** — these define repo purpose, current state, and the raw-vs-latent sync boundary the research must respect. Skipping this is the #1 cause of research notes that ignore the actual codebase architecture.
2. **`list_directory` all three `.research/` folders** — these hold the existing distillation corpus you must not duplicate. (Create `riir-chain/.research/` if it does not yet exist and you are about to drop a chain-flavored note there.)

**Mandatory (before any verdict):**
- `katgpt-rs/README.md` (`read_file`) — public engine purpose, architecture, current feature set.
- `riir-ai/README.md` (`read_file`) — private runtime context (freeze/thaw, self-learn, game systems). Chain is no longer here.
- `riir-chain/README.md` (`read_file`) — private neuro-symbolic chain transport, LatCal, neuron_db, feature-flag umbrellas (`chain`, `chain_economics`, `chain_solana_parity`, `chain_catchup`, `chain_asset_*`, `shard_compactor`, `lora_posterior`). **Required reading for any LatCal / commitment / sync-bridge research.**
- `riir-armageddon/README.md` (`read_file`) — arena/game-product domain types, raw-vs-latent boundary, sync semantics, anti-cheat rules. The research MUST respect this boundary.
- `katgpt-rs/.research/` (`list_directory`) — public modelless research corpus (do not duplicate).
- `riir-ai/.research/` (`list_directory`) — private runtime/game research corpus (do not duplicate). Historical chain notes (pre-spin-off) still live here — grep them too.
- `riir-chain/.research/` (`list_directory` — create the folder on first use) — private chain research corpus. New chain-flavored notes land here, not in `riir-ai/.research/`.
- `riir-ai/crates/riir-engine/src/` (`list_directory`) — **runtime module tree = codebase vocabulary at the highest level.** Module names (`latent_functor/`, `cgsp_runtime/`, `micro_belief/`, `adapters/`, ...) are how the codebase describes its own mechanisms. Skipping this caused the Research DiPOD miss: `latent_functor/reestimation.rs` ships the exact "drift-triggered self-healing swap" pattern under the name "coherence-driven re-estimation scheduler" — invisible to a paper-vocabulary grep.
- `riir-ai/crates/riir-games/src/` (`list_directory`) — game systems module tree (same rationale).
- `riir-chain/src/` (`list_directory`) — chain module tree: `encoding/` (LatCal), `neuron_db/`, `consensus/`, `economics/`, `asset_lifecycle/`, `forensic/`, `programs/`, `validator/`, `wallet/`, `batch/`, `catchup/`, `deploy/`, `shell/`.

If you have NOT `read_file` all four READMEs AND `list_directory` all three `.research/` folders AND the three runtime/chain crate src trees, STOP and do so now. Do not create any file until all eleven are done.

Then read for additional context (as relevant to the topic):
- `katgpt-rs/src/` + `katgpt-rs/crates/katgpt-core/src/` — existing modelless primitives (ConstraintPruners, bandits, DDTree, speculative decode).
- `riir-ai/crates/` — runtime IP: `riir-engine`, `riir-games`, `riir-ffi`, `riir-data`, `riir-examples`. **(`riir-chain` and `riir-chaind` moved to the `riir-chain/` repo — do not look for them here.)**
- `riir-chain/crates/` — chain daemon crate: `riir-chaind`. (LatCal, neuron_db, encoding, etc. live under `riir-chain/src/`.)
- `katgpt-rs/.plans/` + `riir-ai/.plans/` + `riir-chain/.plans/` — existing plans. **Do NOT list these in pre-flight.** Grep them during fusion search (§Workflow step 1), not as grounding — they describe what we *plan to build*, not what the repos *are*.

## Primary focus (distill HERE in katgpt-rs / riir-ai)

**Fusion-first mindset:** The highest-value Super-GOATs in this codebase come from **fusing 2–3 papers/primitives into a novel combination**, not from direct-mapping a single paper. Always grep `.research/` + `.plans/` for the 2–3 closest cousins before verdict, and ask: "what does paper × note A × note B produce that none of them alone can?" Examples that shipped: Gemini Fourier × LatCal (research 212 → plan 242); EGA × SpectralQuant (research 100 × 039); collapse-aware × bandit × sigmoid-margin (plans 212 × 157 × 061). See §Workflow step 1 for the full fusion protocol.

- **Latent-to-latent operations** — anything that stays in embedding/latent space: dot-product projections, cosine similarity retrieval, sigmoid-gated routing, manifold geometry, spectral methods on activations. Prefer operating on latents over decoding to tokens then re-encoding. **Fusion hook:** combine with freeze/thaw to version latent-direction vectors; combine with self-learn to update direction vectors from runtime curiosity signal.
- **Freeze/thaw patterns** — versioned weight snapshots, atomic hot-swap, lock-free read paths, BLAKE3/commitment-checked adapter reload, per-entity personality divergence via snapshot versioning. **Fusion hook:** combine with runtime adapter routing to dispatch by latent-state similarity; combine with self-learn to snapshot emergent NPC personalities.
- **Runtime adapter routing** — selecting between frozen adapters by state/objective/context (Dynamic Pair, Polytope, dMoE — all inference-time, zero training). **Fusion hook:** combine with freeze/thaw to make the adapter pool itself versioned and BLAKE3-committed; combine with bandits to learn routing policy online.
- **Self-learn / adaptive CoT** — runtime curiosity, entropy-driven exploration, collapse detection/recovery, latent prediction SSL, trajectory folding. No LLM training, no backprop through weights — runtime self-improvement via latent-space updates is welcome. **Fusion hook:** combine with MMORPG-scale game AI to give thousands of NPCs independent curiosity/entropy signals; combine with freeze/thaw to checkpoint learned latent directions.
- **Modelless inference primitives** — ConstraintPruners, bandits, DDTree, speculative decode, sparse attention, quantization-aware inference.
- **MMORPG-scale game AI** — thousands of concurrent NPCs each with independent latent state, real-time latency budgets (20Hz tick, plasma/hot tier), spatial partitioning + fog-of-war, emergent social/economic behavior (factions, trade routes, reputation), zone-level attention routing, crowd-scale curiosity/exploration signals. Latent ops must batch across many entities; raw sync must stay bit-identical for deterministic replay/anti-cheat.

### Super-GOAT factory modules — grep FIRST, explicitly

The highest-value latent-space Super-GOATs cluster in five module trees. When grepping for fusion cousins and prior art, `list_directory` these explicitly — do NOT rely on keyword grep alone (vocabulary mismatch is the #3 cause of false verdicts):

| Module | What ships | Super-GOAT angle |
|---|---|---|
| `katgpt-rs/crates/katgpt-core/src/sense/` | HLA belief-state kernels, `evolve_hla`, `SenseModule::project`, ternary bit-plane projection | Per-NPC recurrent latent state — the runtime substrate for any "hidden state" / "belief" / "activation" paper |
| `riir-ai/crates/riir-engine/src/latent_functor/` | `zone_gating.rs`, `reestimation.rs`, `arithmetic.rs`, `cross_game.rs`, `k_selector.rs`, `quality_gate.rs` | **Game-theory in latent space** — functors as vector ops, coherence-driven re-estimation, zone-gated activation. Maps any "stage" / "application" / "bypass" / "collapse" paper |
| `riir-ai/crates/riir-engine/src/hla/` | `kernel.rs`, `forward.rs`, `types.rs` — per-NPC 8-dim latent state (valence/arousal/desperation/calm/fear + 3) | The emotional/cognitive latent state — maps any "subspace" / "width" / "channel" paper to per-NPC affect |
| `riir-ai/crates/riir-engine/src/cgsp_runtime/` | Curiosity-guided self-play, latent prediction SSL, MCTS collapse bridge | Runtime curiosity/exploration — maps any "self-learn" / "entropy-driven" / "collapse recovery" paper |
| `riir-chain/src/encoding/latcal*.rs` + `latcal_fixed.rs` | Lattice Calculus: 2×2 matrix arithmetic obfuscation, fixed-point bridge, spectral fixed-point, batch determinant validation, DeFi programs | **The sync-boundary bridge** — deterministic, committed, raw-numeric. Maps any "fixed-point" / "deterministic commitment" / "raw↔latent bridge" / "arithmetic obfuscation" paper. LatCal is how latent ops become chain-committed raw values. **Lives in the standalone `riir-chain/` repo, not `riir-ai`.** |

**Adapter routing, KV compression, and speculative decode are GOAT-tier framings. Latent-to-latent operations on HLA/functor/LatCal state are Super-GOAT-tier framings. Attempt the Super-GOAT framing first.** Defaulting to adapter routing when a latent-space reframing is stronger is a documented failure mode (see R269 in §1.5).

## Redirect to riir-train (do NOT distill here)

If a paper is training-only → note "→ riir-train" in one line and stop. Do not create files in this session for it.

**By topic:**
- LoRA / OFT / SPEFT / IA3 / QLoRA / ManifoldE / BAKE / GPart / MSA / Dendritic and all adapter-**training** methods.
- Training optimizers (Muon, Adam variants, symmetry-compatible optimizers).
- Training loss functions, curricula, distillation recipes.
- Quantization-aware **training** (quantization-aware **inference** stays here).
- DPO / GRPO / SFT / RL **training** pipelines (runtime GRPO self-play stays in `riir-ai` — it updates latent state, not weights).
- Anything that requires backpropagation through base weights.

**By user-request phrasing (these mean "→ riir-train"):**
- "Train a LoRA adapter to do X"
- "Fine-tune with method Y"
- "Optimizer Z improves convergence"
- "Distillation recipe from teacher to student"
- "Quantization-aware training" (but "quantization-aware inference" stays here)
- "DPO/GRPO/SFT/RL training pipeline" (but runtime GRPO self-play stays in riir-ai)

## Distillation targets (4-repo strategy)

Per `katgpt-rs/.research/003_Commercial_Open_Source_Strategy_Verdict.md` (note: that doc predates the `riir-chain` spin-off — treat the table below as the current authoritative routing; updating `003_*.md` itself is tracked separately):

| Repo | Role | What lands here |
|------|------|-----------------|
| `katgpt-rs` (public, MIT) | Engine — modelless inference framework | Generic primitives: ConstraintPruner traits, bandits, DDTree, speculative decode, sparse attention kernels. **No game IP, no chain IP.** |
| `riir-ai` (private) | Game product — freeze/thaw runtime, self-learn, game systems | Runtime IP: `LoRAWeightVersion`, `LoRAHotSwap`, `dispatch_lora_merge`, `TrainingProvider` trait, routing, game systems. **No chain code — chain lives in `riir-chain/`.** |
| `riir-chain` (private) | Neuro-symbolic chain transport — LatCal, neuron_db, chaind | Chain IP: LatCal encoding/bridges, split-key ledger, chain economics, Solana-parity features, asset lifecycle / forensic, `riir-chaind` daemon, validator SDK bridges. |
| `riir-train` (private) | Training research vault | **Only if the paper's value is its training method.** Out of scope for this workflow — just note "→ riir-train" and move on. |

Distill into:
- **Modelless** → `katgpt-rs/.research/` + `katgpt-rs/.plans/` + `katgpt-rs/src/` (or `katgpt-rs/crates/katgpt-core/`)
- **Runtime/game** → `riir-ai/.research/` + `riir-ai/.plans/` + `riir-ai/crates/`
- **Chain / LatCal / sync-bridge / neuron_db / commitment** → `riir-chain/.research/` (create if missing) + `riir-chain/.plans/` + `riir-chain/src/` (or `riir-chain/crates/`)
- **Training-only** → note the redirect, do not create files in this session

## Workflow

### 0. Read & classify the paper

Fetch via `https://r.jina.ai/https://arxiv.org/pdf/{ID}` (per AGENTS.md). Ask: *is the value in the training loop, or in a latent-space / inference / routing insight?* If training-only → note "→ riir-train", stop.

### 1. Distill fundamentally — fuse, don't just direct-map

Don't direct-map the paper to our code. Find the transferable primitive: the geometric, spectral, or information-theoretic insight that works without the paper's training setup. **Then look for fusion opportunities**: cross-pollinate this paper's insight with existing `.research/` notes, `.plans/`, and shipped primitives to synthesize a *novel* combination. The highest-value Super-GOATs in freeze/thaw runtime and self-learn/adaptive CoT almost always come from **fusing** 2–3 papers, not from a single-paper direct mapping.

**Fusion examples that shipped:**
- Gemini Fourier × LatCal → `katgpt-rs/.research/212_Gemini_Fourier_LatCal_Fusion_Verdict.md` → `katgpt-rs/.plans/242_Fourier_Smoothed_Potential_Fields_LEO.md`
- EGA spectral salience × SpectralQuant eigenbasis KV compression → `katgpt-rs/.research/100_*.md` + `039_*.md`
- Collapse-aware × bandit coverage × sigmoid margin → `katgpt-rs/.plans/212_*`, `157_*`, `061_*`
- G-Zero self-play × Hint-δ bandit × absorb-compress → `katgpt-rs/.plans/049_*` (modelless self-play distillation, 1.16M cycles/sec)

**Fusion protocol:**
1. **MANDATORY — grep ALL FOUR repos in this session, BOTH layers (notes AND code). Do NOT stop after the first repo or the first layer.** Run keyword / paper-title / author / primitive-name grep across:
   - `katgpt-rs/.research/` + `katgpt-rs/.plans/` (intent — what we planned)
   - `riir-ai/.research/` + `riir-ai/.plans/` (intent — runtime/game, plus historical chain notes pre-spin-off)
   - `riir-chain/.research/` + `riir-chain/.plans/` (intent — current chain research; `.research/` may need creating on first use)
   - `katgpt-rs/src/` + `katgpt-rs/crates/` (shipped primitives — what actually exists)
   - `riir-ai/crates/` (shipped runtime — no longer contains `riir-chain`/`riir-chaind`)
   - `riir-chain/src/` + `riir-chain/crates/` (shipped chain — LatCal, neuron_db, encoding, economics, forensic, etc.)
   - `riir-armageddon/crates/` (shipped game/arena domain types, raw-vs-latent boundary)
   - **Super-GOAT factory modules** (from §Primary focus) — `list_directory` these explicitly even if the paper looks pure-training: `katgpt-rs/crates/katgpt-core/src/sense/`, `riir-ai/crates/riir-engine/src/latent_functor/`, `riir-ai/crates/riir-engine/src/hla/`, `riir-ai/crates/riir-engine/src/cgsp_runtime/`, `riir-chain/src/encoding/latcal*.rs`

   (riir-train is deliberately excluded — training methods are out of scope for this workflow.)

   Two layers, four repos. The closest cousin is frequently in the OTHER repo (e.g., a `katgpt-rs` modelless primitive fused with a `riir-chain` LatCal commitment bridge — see Gemini Fourier × LatCal) OR in the CODE not the notes. **Notes describe intent; code describes what shipped.** A mechanism can ship without a research note — e.g., HLA's `evolve_hla` (`katgpt-rs/crates/katgpt-core/src/sense/reconstruction.rs`) is a per-NPC recurrent belief-state kernel with no `.research/` note framing it as such; a notes-only grep misses it and produces a false Super-GOAT claim (this exact failure happened on Research 242 — verdict had to be revised Super-GOAT → GOAT). If you only grep `katgpt-rs/.research/`, you will miss both axes and produce a duplicate, weaker note, or an overclaimed verdict.

2. **MANDATORY — vocabulary translation before grepping.** Papers and our codebase use different words for the same mechanism. Before any grep, list the paper's 3–5 key mechanism terms, then for EACH, brainstorm ≥2 codebase-equivalent terms by asking: "if we shipped this, what would we call it?" Then grep BOTH sets.

   **Standing latent-state vocabulary (ALWAYS include, even for non-latent papers — most architecture/training papers have a latent-space reframing):**
   - "residual stream" / "hidden state" / "activation" → "HLA state", "belief state", "latent subspace", "sense projection"
   - "layer" / "depth" / "stage" → "decision stage", "functor application", "cgsp cycle", "consolidation tick"
   - "width" / "dimension" / "capacity" → "latent subspace", "active projection channel", "sense channel"
   - "carry-forward" / "bypass" / "skip" → "leaky integrator", "dormant subspace", "decay gate", "persistence"
   - "collapse" / "degeneration" / "valley" → "coherence decay", "re-estimation trigger", "staleness"
   - "bottleneck" / "narrowing" → "subspace projection", "channel selection", "zone gating"
   - "fixed-point" / "deterministic" / "committed" → "LatCal", "lattice calculus", "BLAKE3 commitment", "raw scalar bridge"

   Example (DiPOD paper → riir-ai code):
   - "double drift" / "ELBO drift" → "coherence decay", "staleness", "divergence"
   - "self-distillation" → "re-estimation", "re-derive", "recommit"
   - "tight bound" / "adequate estimator" → "coherence > tau", "parallelism quality", "confidence gate"
   - "policy-preserving" → "atomic Arc swap", "readers keep old snapshot"
   - "drop-in regularizer" → "feature flag", "warm-tier scheduler tick"

   Grep ONLY paper vocabulary → misses `latent_functor/reestimation.rs` (which ships DiPOD's exact pattern under the name "coherence-driven re-estimation scheduler"). Grep BOTH sets → hits it on the first pass. **This is the #2 cause of false Super-GOAT claims (after notes-only grep) — and arguably worse, because the mechanism DOES have a research note (Research 123 + Plan 303) that also uses codebase vocabulary, so even a notes grep misses it.**

3. **MANDATORY — latent-space reframing before verdict.** Before any verdict, re-cast the paper's core mechanism as a latent-to-latent operation on the codebase's latent-state kernels (the five Super-GOAT factory modules above). Ask explicitly: "How does this mechanism look when operating on (a) HLA's per-NPC latent state, (b) `latent_functor/` operations, (c) `cgsp_runtime/` curiosity signals, (d) LatCal fixed-point commitment (in `riir-chain/src/encoding/`)?" If your fusion idea only touches adapter routing / KV compression / speculative decode without a latent-state reframing, you are likely in GOAT territory and have probably missed the Super-GOAT angle. The latent reframing is mandatory even for papers that look pure-training/architecture — most have a latent subspace / stage-gating / persistence angle that lands in HLA/functor.

4. **Zero grep hits ≠ novelty.** If your paper-vocabulary grep AND your codebase-vocabulary grep BOTH return zero hits, that is evidence of one of three things, in order of likelihood: (a) you are still using the wrong vocabulary — try a third semantic angle (e.g., grep for the *output behavior* like "swap when X" instead of the *mechanism name* like "tightness monitor"); (b) the mechanism is genuinely not shipped; (c) the mechanism is novel. Do NOT jump to (c). Default to (a): re-grep with at least one more semantic alternative before claiming "no prior art".
5. After finding the transferable primitive of *this* paper, list the 2–3 closest existing notes/plans **across both repos** and ask: "what novel combination of this paper + note A + note B produces a capability none of them has alone?" Write that combination into the research note's §Distillation as a **Fusion** subsection, even if you don't plan it yet.
6. Verdict by the commercial strategy doc (`003_*.md`): **Super-GOAT** > GOAT > Gain > Pass (see §Verdict tiers below). **A fusion that produces a new capability class is a strong Super-GOAT candidate — check the novelty gate (§1.5).**
7. Create research `.md` at the right repo (see table above).

**File naming:** `{NNN}_{Short_Title_with_Underscores}.md` where NNN is the next free number (zero-padded to 3 digits, e.g. `239_`, `240_`). Check the folder first — numbers may be non-contiguous; pick the next free slot.

**Research note format** (see `katgpt-rs/.research/238_LoRA_Muon_Spectral_Low_Rank_Manifold.md` for a canonical example):

```markdown
# Research NNN: <Title>

> **Source:** <paper title + arxiv link + authors + date>
> **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
> **Status:** Active | Done | Shelved
> **Related Research:** NNN (short note), ...
> **Related Plans:** NNN (short note), ...
> **Cross-ref (riir-ai / riir-chain):** Research NNN, Plan NNN   ← only if cross-repo (game runtime → riir-ai; chain/LatCal → riir-chain)
> **Classification:** Public | Private   ← katgpt-rs notes are always Public

## TL;DR

<2-4 sentences: the distilled primitive, why it matters here, what it unblocks>

**Distilled for katgpt-rs (modelless, inference-time):**
<the transferable insight, stripped of training setup>

## 1. Paper Core Findings

## 2. Distillation

## 3. Verdict

**Tiers (high → low):**

| Tier | Criteria | Routing |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Super-GOAT** | Novel mechanism (no prior art) + new capability class + product selling point + force multiplier (≥2 pillars). Creates a moat. | Open primitive → katgpt-rs. **Architectural guide → riir-ai/.research/ (game runtime) OR riir-chain/.research/ (chain/LatCal)**. Plans → appropriate repo(s) as needed. |
| **GOAT** | Provable gain (latency/quality/security) over existing approach, but not a new class of capability. Promotes to default if it wins. | Plan + implement → appropriate repo. Feature flag + benchmark. |
| **Gain** | Incremental improvement, useful but not headline-worthy. | Plan only, behind feature flag. |
| **Pass** | Not relevant to modelless/latent/freeze-thaw/runtime, OR training-only (→ riir-train note, stop). | One-line note. No files created in this session. |

**One-line reasoning required for each verdict.** For Super-GOAT: state the selling point explicitly.
```

### 1.5. Novelty gate — is this Super-GOAT?

Before planning, score novelty. Ask all four:

1. **No prior art?** Grep `.research/` + `.plans/` across all repos AND grep the shipped code (`katgpt-rs/src/`, `katgpt-rs/crates/`, `riir-ai/crates/`, `riir-chain/src/`, `riir-chain/crates/`, `riir-armageddon/crates/`) for the primitive name and mechanism keywords. **You MUST grep BOTH paper vocabulary AND codebase-vocabulary alternatives (see §Workflow fusion protocol step 2 — vocabulary translation).** **Notes describe intent; code describes what shipped.** A mechanism can ship under either of two failure modes:
   - **No notes framing at all** — canonical example: HLA's `evolve_hla` (`katgpt-rs/crates/katgpt-core/src/sense/reconstruction.rs`) is a per-NPC recurrent belief-state kernel with no `.research/` note framing it as such; missing it caused the Research 242 Super-GOAT overclaim.
   - **Notes framing uses different vocabulary than the paper** — canonical example: DiPOD's "interleave self-distillation when ELBO drifts" is shipped as `riir-ai/crates/riir-engine/src/latent_functor/reestimation.rs` "coherence-driven re-estimation scheduler when coherence < tau_reest". Research 123 + Plan 303 DO frame the mechanism, but using codebase vocabulary, so a paper-vocabulary grep misses it on BOTH notes AND code layers. This is strictly worse than the `evolve_hla` failure: even a diligent notes grep fails. **Vocabulary translation (fusion protocol step 2) is the only defense.**
   If the code already covers the mechanism → not novel, Gain at best. **This three-layer check (notes + code + vocabulary translation) is mandatory — notes-only is the #1 cause of false Super-GOAT claims; paper-vocabulary-only is the #2 cause; skipping the five Super-GOAT factory modules is the #3 cause.**
2. **New class of behavior?** Not better numbers, but something no incumbent can do (a new capability, not an optimization).
3. **Product selling point?** Can you finish the sentence: "Our NPCs/systems do X that no competitor can"? If you can't → Gain.
4. **Force multiplier?** Connects to ≥2 existing pillars/systems (check connection map in `.research/`). Solo novelty without integration = GOAT, not Super-GOAT.

**Documented failure (R269, 2026-06-19):** `> <former` (variable-width transformers) initially verdict'd Pass, then revised to "fusion TBD" with an **adapter-routing** framing after user pushback on on-the-fly LoRA. User's second pushback ("aim for latent-to-latent, HLA, functor") revealed the stronger framing the skill should have found first: variable width = **stage-gated HLA subspace activation** (combat→survival subspace, dialog→social subspace); carry-forward = **dormant subspace persistence** via HLA leaky integrator; ×-shape = **LatCal-style projection profile** across decision stages. The adapter-routing framing was GOAT-tier at best; the latent-functor-LatCal framing is Super-GOAT-tier. **Lesson: default to the latent-space reframing (fusion protocol step 3) before committing any verdict. Adapter routing is a fallback framing, not the primary one.**

**If YES to all 4 → verdict = Super-GOAT.** Mandatory outputs:
1. **Open primitive** → `katgpt-rs` (generic math, no game semantics).
2. **Architectural GUIDE** → the private selling-point doc. **Pick the repo by where the selling point lives**: `riir-ai/.research/NNN_*.md` for game-runtime / HLA / functor / self-learn selling points; `riir-chain/.research/NNN_*.md` for chain / LatCal / commitment / neuron_db / sync-bridge selling points (create folder on first use). If the selling point spans both (e.g., latent ops that cross the chain sync boundary), create the primary guide in the repo that owns the boundary being crossed, and cross-reference from the other. The guide MUST include:
   - TL;DR with commercial value (the selling point in one sentence)
   - Distilled primitive (how the mechanism works modellessly)
   - Connection map (which existing systems it multiplies)
   - Latent vs raw boundary (what crosses sync, what stays local)
   - What stays private vs open
   - Validation protocol (how to prove it's Super-GOAT, not just hype)
   - Implementation priority table (P0–P3)
3. **Plan(s)** → `katgpt-rs/.plans/` (open) and/or `riir-ai/.plans/` (private runtime) and/or `riir-chain/.plans/` (private chain).

**If NO to any → proceed to GOAT/Gain verdict.** Plan only, no guide.

> **Rule:** Super-GOAT ideas are the private IP moat. The open primitive is the adoption hook; the riir-ai/riir-chain guide is the selling point. Never ship the guide publicly. Never skip the guide for a Super-GOAT — that's losing the knowledge.
>
> **No "candidate" escape hatch.** If you write "all 4 YES", "passes the novelty gate", or "Super-GOAT candidate" anywhere in a note (main verdict OR a fusion subsection), the mandatory outputs above apply **in this same session** — open primitive in katgpt-rs, **private guide (riir-ai OR riir-chain, by selling-point domain) created now**, plans as needed. The guide *contains* the validation protocol (G1–Gn gate), so you create it **before** running the gate, not after. Deferring the guide "until validation passes" inverts the order and silently drops the moat doc — this is the #1 way selling points leak into the public repo.
>
> If you are NOT confident enough to commit all 4 YES right now, **do not write "Super-GOAT candidate"**. Write "fusion idea — novelty TBD, needs Q1–Q4 check before verdict" and create an issue in `.issues/` to track the follow-up. "Candidate" is not a deferred-commitment escape hatch — it either triggers the guide now, or it gets downgraded to an issue.

### 2. If gain (or GOAT), plan it

Add plan `.md` to `katgpt-rs/.plans/` (modelless), `riir-ai/.plans/` (runtime/game), and/or `riir-chain/.plans/` (chain / LatCal / neuron_db). Use `## Phase N` sections with `- [ ]` per task (mark `- [x]` when done). **Never** plan into `riir-train` from this workflow.

> Super-GOAT plans should be created AFTER the riir-ai guide. The guide is the strategy; the plan is the execution.

**Plan format** (see `katgpt-rs/.plans/271_attention_matching_compaction.md` for a canonical example):

```markdown
# Plan NNN: <Title>

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Research:** [katgpt-rs/.research/NNN_*.md](../.research/NNN_*.md)
**Source paper:** [arxiv ID.NNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/ID) — <short cite>
**Target:** `katgpt-rs/src/<module>/` (new module) + Cargo feature `<feature_name>`
**Status:** Active — Phase N <state>

---

## Goal

<one paragraph: what ships, what it enables, GOAT gate>

## Phase 1 — Unblocking Skeleton (CORE)

### Tasks

- [ ] **T1.1** <concrete, verifiable task>
- [ ] **T1.2** ...
```

**GOAT gate rule** (AGENTS.md): every plan that introduces a new technique must have a feature flag and a benchmark proving the gain before promoting to default. Demote the loser if the new technique wins.

### 3. Implement to unblock

If a plan is blocked by a missing primitive, implement the minimal version. After GOAT check + proof of gain: promote to default if it wins, demote the loser.

### 4. Search if curious

Keyword search arxiv:

```
https://r.jina.ai/https://arxiv.org/search/advanced?advanced=&terms-0-operator=AND&terms-0-term={KEYWORD}&terms-0-field=abstract&classification-computer_science=y&classification-mathematics=y&classification-physics_archives=all&classification-statistics=y&classification-include_cross_list=include&date-filter_by=all_dates&date-year=&date-from_date=&date-to_date=&date-date_type=submitted_date&abstracts=show&size=50&order=-announced_date_first
```

Good keywords: `latent space routing`, `adapter hot-swap`, `inference-time composition`, `spectral pruning`, `sigmoid gating`, `snapshot consistency`, `lock-free weight swap`.

## Constraints (non-negotiable)

1. **Modelless first** — inference-time only. No LLM training, no backprop through base weights. Closest to "training" allowed: freeze/thaw snapshot cycles and latent-space direction-vector updates at runtime.
2. **Latent-to-latent preferred** — operate in embedding/latent space as long as possible. Decode to tokens or project to raw scalars only at the boundary. Use dot-product + **sigmoid** (never softmax) for projections onto learned direction vectors. Semantic domain (emotion, mood, curiosity, style) → latent. Physical domain (position, HP, wallet balance) → raw, deterministic, synced.
3. **Freeze/thaw over fine-tuning** — the only weight mutation allowed at runtime is swapping a frozen snapshot (atomic, versioned, BLAKE3-checked). Never mutate weights in-place during inference. If a paper needs gradient updates, redirect to riir-train.
4. **Self-learn / adaptive CoT welcome** — runtime curiosity, latent prediction, trajectory folding, collapse detection. These update latent state / direction vectors / routing tables, NOT base weights.
5. **4-repo discipline** — katgpt-rs (public engine) → riir-ai (private runtime/game) → riir-chain (private chain) → riir-train (private training). Keep the commercial strategy intact. Training know-how never leaks to katgpt-rs; chain IP stays in `riir-chain/`, not `riir-ai/`.
6. **SOLID, DRY** — per `katgpt-rs/.contexts/optimization.md`. Zero-allocation hot paths. Pre-computed lookup tables. Fixed-size arrays for bounded domains.
7. **Tests/examples** — before/after showing the gain (latency, quality, or security). For latent ops: show the projection preserves ranking. For freeze/thaw: show readers never see torn snapshots.
8. **CPU/GPU/ANE auto-route** — threshold-adaptive dispatch. Plasma (µs, CPU/SIMD) → Hot (sub-ms, GPU) → Warm/Cold (ms+, GPU/ANE). Latent ops that fit in L1 cache stay on SIMD; manifold ops that need batched matmul go to GPU.
9. **Plasma → Hot → Warm → Cold → Freeze tiering** — aim for perf on game side (plasma/hot latency budget) AND security on chain side (cold/freeze commitment, BLAKE3-hashed, tamper-evident). Latent state that crosses the sync boundary MUST be raw scalars (valence/arousal/desperation/calm/fear), never the full embedding vector.

## Latent vs raw space rules (critical for game AI)

Reinforce these when designing game systems or chain state:

- **Physical domain** (position, velocity, HP, wallet balance): MUST remain raw exact values. Deterministic replay, quorum sync, anti-cheat require bit-identical reconstruction.
- **Semantic domain** (emotion, mood, curiosity, style, habit): SHOULD operate in latent space via dot-product + sigmoid onto learned direction vectors.
- **Social domain** (encounters, relationships, factions): SHOULD produce KG triples from proximity in latent/embedding space, not from raw coordinate distance.

**Sync boundary:** if data flows through `SyncBlock → ChainConsensus` quorum commit → Cold tier, it MUST be raw and deterministic. If data is consumed locally (emotion projection, shard retrieval, consolidation sleep-cycle), it SHOULD be latent. Bridge functions (raw→latent projection, latent→raw scalar clamp) MUST be zero-allocation, gateable by feature flag, and not introduce sync dependency.

**KG triple emission:** semantic encounters → KG triple from latent similarity. Physical events → TxDelta with raw values, NOT KG triple. Never substitute latent embedding for raw position in anti-cheat validation.

**Spatial cognition (two-brain model):** info brain = real `MapPos` (synced, ground truth). Think brain = per-NPC `SpatialBelief` (zone-level KG triple + stale last_known_pos, fog-of-war gated, NOT synced). Bridge is one-way: real position → belief update only when within `visible_radius`. Confidence decay: `sigmoid(-λ * (current_tick - last_observed_tick))`. Two brains MUST exist independently — divergence is emergent behavior, not a bug.

## TL;DR

This skill packages the katgpt-rs research workflow: **MANDATORY pre-flight: `read_file` all four READMEs (`katgpt-rs/README.md`, `riir-ai/README.md`, `riir-chain/README.md`, `riir-armageddon/README.md`) AND `list_directory` all three `.research/` folders (`katgpt-rs/.research/`, `riir-ai/.research/`, `riir-chain/.research/` — create the last on first use) AND the three runtime/chain crate src trees (`riir-ai/crates/riir-engine/src/`, `riir-ai/crates/riir-games/src/`, `riir-chain/src/`) before any verdict** → read paper → classify (training? → riir-train, stop) → **distill + fuse** (find the transferable primitive, then **vocabulary-translate** paper terms to ≥2 codebase-equivalent terms each INCLUDING the standing latent-state vocabulary, then grep BOTH layers — `.research/`+`.plans/` for intent AND `src/`+`crates/` for shipped code — across all four repos, using BOTH paper vocabulary AND codebase vocabulary, AND `list_directory` the **five Super-GOAT factory modules** explicitly: `katgpt-rs/crates/katgpt-core/src/sense/` (HLA), `riir-ai/crates/riir-engine/src/latent_functor/`, `riir-ai/crates/riir-engine/src/hla/`, `riir-ai/crates/riir-engine/src/cgsp_runtime/`, `riir-chain/src/encoding/latcal*.rs` (LatCal — **now in the standalone `riir-chain/` repo, not `riir-ai/crates/riir-chain/`**) — for the 2–3 closest cousins to synthesize a novel combination) → **MANDATORY latent-space reframing before verdict** (re-cast the mechanism as a latent-to-latent op on HLA/functor/cgsp/LatCal state; adapter routing / KV compression / speculative decode are GOAT-tier fallback framings, NOT the primary) → **novelty gate** (Super-GOAT? → open primitive + private riir-ai or riir-chain guide depending on whether the selling point is game runtime or chain transport; else GOAT/Gain → plan only). **Zero grep hits ≠ novelty — try one more semantic angle before claiming "no prior art"** → implement behind feature flag → benchmark → promote GOAT or demote loser. Hard constraints: modelless-first, latent-to-latent with sigmoid (never softmax), freeze/thaw over fine-tuning, 4-repo commercial discipline (public engine / private runtime / private chain / private training), raw scalars at the sync boundary, **fusion-first mindset** (the best Super-GOATs come from fusing papers across all four repos, not direct-mapping one). **Super-GOAT = private moat; never skip the riir-ai/riir-chain guide. Never grep only katgpt-rs — riir-ai + riir-chain are half the corpus. Never grep only notes — code is half the prior art. Never grep only paper vocabulary — codebase vocabulary is the other half (DiPOD's "self-distillation when ELBO drifts" ships as `latent_functor/reestimation.rs` "coherence-driven re-estimation scheduler when coherence < tau_reest"; missed by paper-vocabulary grep on BOTH notes AND code, even though Research 123 + Plan 303 frame the mechanism under codebase vocabulary). Never default to adapter routing when a latent-functor/HLA/LatCal reframing is available — that is the R269 failure mode. Three canonical failures: `evolve_hla` (no notes framing at all, Research 242 Super-GOAT overclaim), `latent_functor/reestimation.rs` (notes framing under different vocabulary, DiPOD false Super-GOAT claim), and `> <former`/R269 (defaulted to adapter routing instead of stage-gated HLA subspace activation + LatCal projection profile).**
