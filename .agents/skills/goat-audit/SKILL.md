description: Audit cross-repo GOAT/gain primitive cherry-pick status across the 5-repo quintet (katgpt-rs → riir-ai / riir-chain / riir-neuron-db). Detects stalls (default-on in katgpt-rs for ≥7 days with zero runtime wiring in riir-*), DRY violations (duplicated substrate in riir-* that should consume katgpt-core), and SOLID violations. Use when auditing primitive cherry-pick coverage, before opening a plan that consumes a katgpt-rs primitive, or quarterly as a hygiene gate.

# goat-audit — Cross-Repo GOAT/Gain Cherry-Pick Audit

Use this skill when auditing whether the riir-* private repos have consumed the GOAT-validated primitives shipped in `katgpt-rs`. It detects four failure classes:

1. **Stalls** — primitive default-on in katgpt-rs for ≥7 days, zero runtime wiring in riir-*.
2. **DRY violations** — riir-* ships a local copy of substrate that should consume `katgpt-core` / `katgpt-transformer` / `katgpt-pruners`.
3. **SOLID violations** — primitive consumed in the wrong layer (e.g. a sync-boundary primitive wired into a latent-only runtime, or vice versa).
4. **Fork drift (the Issue 019 class)** — riir-* is a fork of katgpt-rs (e.g. `riir-engine/src/lib.rs` says "Extracted from katgpt-rs (MIT, frozen at v0.1.0)") and a Layer 2 struct-name grep hits a file that defines its own `pub struct SameName` with zero `use katgpt_*::` imports. The audit must distinguish **consumer** (true positive, primitive wired) from **duplicate** (false positive, primitive re-implemented locally — the canonical has bit-rotted since v0.1.0).

## When to use

- **Quarterly hygiene gate** — re-audit after every major katgpt-rs release.
- **Before opening a plan** that consumes a katgpt-rs primitive — confirm it isn't already wired (avoid duplicate work).
- **When a user asks** "did riir-* get every good thing from katgpt-rs yet?" (the canonical trigger).
- **After a promotion in katgpt-rs** — track that the riir-* runtime wiring plan is filed within 7 days.

## DO NOT use for

- Paper distillation (use the `research` skill).
- Single-repo refactors with no cross-repo angle.
- Bug fixes with no architectural impact.

## Repos in scope (the 5-repo quintet)

```
katgpt-rs          ← public engine (substrate: katgpt-core + 16 leaf crates + root)
riir-ai            ← private runtime/game (cognitive, ARG, CLR, HLA, karc, cwm, etc.)
riir-chain         ← private chain (LatCal, quorum, asset lifecycle)
riir-neuron-db     ← private neuron-shard leaf (Pod, freeze, consolidation, AnyRAG)
riir-train         ← private training vault (OUT OF SCOPE — training-only methods)
```

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Pre-flight (MANDATORY before any verdict)

Run all of these in parallel; do NOT skip:

1. `read_file katgpt-rs/Cargo.toml` — extract the `default = [...]` feature list. These are the GOAT-validated primitives.
2. `read_file katgpt-rs/crates/katgpt-core/Cargo.toml` — extract substrate features.
3. `read_file riir-ai/crates/riir-engine/Cargo.toml` — extract riir-engine features + the katgpt features each one forwards to.
4. `read_file riir-neuron-db/Cargo.toml` — extract neuron-db features.
5. `read_file riir-chain/Cargo.toml` + `riir-chain/crates/riir-chaind/Cargo.toml` — extract chain features.
6. `list_directory katgpt-rs/.benchmarks` — these track the GOAT gate evidence per primitive.
7. `list_directory riir-ai/.issues` + `riir-ai/.plans` — existing wiring plans/issues to avoid duplication.

### Step 1 — Build the default-on primitive inventory

From `katgpt-rs/Cargo.toml`'s `default = [...]`, build a table:

| Primitive | Default-on since | katgpt-rs plan | Substrate location |
|---|---|---|---|

Source the "default-on since" from the inline comment in the Cargo.toml (e.g. `# zone_density_routing DEFAULT-ON (Plan 351 Phase 3): ...`). If no date, mark "unknown" and treat as fresh.

### Step 2 — For each primitive, check riir-* consumption (THREE-LAYER check)

**Critical lesson (Issue 003):** feature-name grep returns false negatives. The `salience_tri_gate` feature is consumed via `SalienceTriGate::decide_with_delegate_nudge` in `karc_bridge/anticipation.rs` — a feature-name grep missed this; struct/function-name grep caught it.

**Critical lesson (Issue 019, 2026-07-04):** struct-name grep returns false POSITIVES in fork-derived repos. `riir-engine/src/transformer/mod.rs` defined its own `KVCache`/`KVSnapshot`/`PAGE_SIZE` with zero `use katgpt_transformer::` imports even though `katgpt-transformer` was declared as a mandatory dep in `Cargo.toml` and paid for in compile time — the prior audit marked `KVCache` as WIRED when it was actually a local duplicate shadowing the canonical type. Plan 406 Phase 1/2 de-forked these. Layer 3 (consumer-vs-duplicate discrimination) is mandatory before any WIRED verdict.

**Skill correction (2026-07-09, Issue 420):** the prior version of this paragraph cited `riir-engine/src/kvarn_quality.rs` defining `KvCacheQualityReport` as a duplicate of `katgpt-kv::kvarn::KvCacheQualityReport`. That example was factually wrong — `katgpt-kv` does NOT ship `KvCacheQualityReport` (verified: 0 matches across `katgpt-rs/**/*.rs`). The riir-engine type is a legitimately local `ThinkingController` abstraction (Plan 199 T1), NOT fork drift. The `crate::transformer` shadow case above replaces it as the canonical example.

For each primitive, run ALL THREE greps in parallel across `riir-ai/`, `riir-chain/`, `riir-neuron-db/`:

```
# Layer 1 — feature-name grep (catches Cargo.toml forwards + cfg gates)
grep "<feature_name>" riir-ai/**/*.toml riir-chain/**/*.toml riir-neuron-db/**/*.toml

# Layer 2 — struct/function-name grep (catches actual code consumption)
grep "<CamelCaseStruct>|<snake_case_fn>" riir-ai/**/*.rs riir-chain/**/*.rs riir-neuron-db/**/*.rs

# Layer 3 — consumer-vs-duplicate check (MANDATORY for every Layer 2 hit)
# For each file returned by Layer 2, grep the FILE for katgpt imports.
# If the file has zero `use katgpt_*::` lines, the hit is a DUPLICATE, not a consumer.
grep "^use katgpt" <each-file-from-layer-2-results>
```

**Layer 3 classification rules:**
- File has `use katgpt_*::SomeType` AND uses `SomeType` in code → **CONSUMER (true wired)**
- File has zero `use katgpt` lines but defines `pub struct SameName` → **DUPLICATE (fork drift)** — file the file as a de-fork candidate per Issue 019; do NOT count the primitive as wired
- File has `use katgpt_*::SomeType` but the Layer 2 hit name is locally defined → **MERGE candidate** — the file consumes some katgpt types but re-defines the queried primitive locally; needs human review

**Vocabulary translation before grepping:** list the primitive's 3–5 exported type/function names from the source file (e.g. `katgpt-rs/crates/katgpt-pruners/src/soft_reject.rs` exports `SoftRejectVerdict`, `SoftRejectConfig`, `soft_reject_decide`, `soft_reject_with_relax`, `RelaxationStrategy`, `NoRelaxation`). Grep for ALL of them, not just the feature name.

### Step 3 — Classify each primitive

| Class | Criteria | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Wired (DEFAULT-ON)** | Layer 3 CONSUMER in riir-* runtime AND promoted to default-on in riir-engine/riir-games | No action |
| **Wired (opt-in)** | Layer 3 CONSUMER in riir-* runtime, opt-in feature in riir-* | Check the opt-in reason; if "until GOAT gate passes" and the gate is overdue, flag |
| **Stall** | Default-on in katgpt-rs ≥7 days, zero Layer 3 CONSUMER (Layers 1+2 miss OR Layer 2 hits are all DUPLICATES) | **File `.issues/` in the appropriate riir-* repo** |
| **Fork drift (Issue 019 class)** | Layer 2 hit but Layer 3 says DUPLICATE — riir-* file defines its own `pub struct SameName` with no `use katgpt_*::` | **File de-fork task in `.issues/` — see Issue 019** for the canonical riir-engine substrate de-fork plan |
| **Partial** | Layer 3 CONSUMER in one riir-* repo but the natural second consumer is missing | Note in issue; defer if natural consumer doesn't exist yet |
| **Deliberate** | Has a documented reason for not being wired (e.g. `claim_rubric` is CI-only by design) | No action |
| **Too fresh** | Default-on <7 days | Defer; re-audit next quarter |

### Step 4 — DRY / SOLID check

**Two complementary checks: the `crate::*` scan (catches imports) and the zero-import scan (catches fork drift).**

#### Check A — `crate::*` substrate refs (the Plan 008 lesson)

For each katgpt-core/katgpt-transformer/katgpt-pruners substrate module, check riir-engine src for `crate::*` imports of substrate that should be `katgpt_*::`:

```
# If riir-engine has its own hla/transformer/types.rs/tokenizer.rs/dd_tree.rs that
# duplicates katgpt-core, that's a DRY violation (Plan 008 class).
grep "crate::hla|crate::transformer|crate::types|crate::tokenizer|crate::dd_tree|crate::spec_types|crate::mcts|crate::sampling|crate::delta_mem|crate::simd" riir-ai/crates/riir-engine/src/**/*.rs
```

All should be `katgpt_core::*` / `katgpt_transformer::*` / `katgpt_speculative::*` (Plan 008 Phase 2 closure). Any remaining `crate::*` is a DRY violation.

#### Check B — Zero-import substrate files (the Issue 019 lesson)

Fork drift can hide in files that have NO `crate::*` substrate refs and NO `use katgpt_*::` lines — pure standalone local impls. Check B finds them:

```
# List all .rs files in riir-engine/src that have zero katgpt imports.
# Every substrate-side file in this list is a fork-drift candidate.
for f in $(find riir-ai/crates/riir-engine/src -name '*.rs'); do
  if ! grep -q '^use katgpt' "$f"; then
    echo "ZERO-IMPORT: $f"
  fi
done
```

For each ZERO-IMPORT file, manually classify:
- **Substrate duplicate** (matches a katgpt-* leaf module) → de-fork candidate per Issue 019
- **riir-only runtime** (cognitive stack like clr/karc/cgsp with no katgpt equivalent) → KEEP, not a violation
- **Test/example file** → exempt

The cognitive stack (arg_runtime, bom_arena, cce_runtime, etc.) intentionally has riir-local files; the LLM-substrate layer (transformer, quant, sampling, kv, lora-adapters, mcts, delta_mem) is where drift hides.

For SOLID: check that primitives are consumed in the right layer:
- Sync-boundary primitives (chain commitment, Merkle root) → riir-chain or riir-neuron-db, NOT riir-ai runtime.
- Latent-only primitives (emotion projection, set attention) → riir-ai runtime, NOT riir-chain.
- Substrate (SIMD, transformer, types) → katgpt-core, NOT riir-engine local.

### Step 5 — Output

Write the audit to a new `.issues/NNN_cross_repo_goat_cherry_pick_audit.md` file in the riir-* repo that owns the largest gap (usually riir-ai). Use this format:

```markdown
# Issue NNN: Cross-Repo GOAT/Gain Cherry-Pick Audit

## TL;DR
<one paragraph: how many stalls, which is strongest, what's the fix>

## Gap inventory (default-on in katgpt-rs, NOT cherry-picked)
| # | Primitive | Default-on since | riir-* status | Class |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | ... | ... | ... | TRUE GAP — fix |
| T2 | ... | ... | ... | Stall — defer |

## What IS wired (the strong half)
<list of consumed primitives, no action>

## Tasks
### Phase 1 — T1 <strongest stall>
- [ ] T1.1 ...
```

### Step 6 — Commit + report

Per global AGENTS.md rule, commit on `develop` (no feature branches):

```bash
git add .issues/NNN_cross_repo_goat_cherry_pick_audit.md
git commit -m "docs: file issue NNN — cross-repo GOAT cherry-pick audit (T1: <strongest stall>)"
```

Report to the user:
- Total primitives audited (count of katgpt-rs default-on).
- Stalls found (with days-since-promotion).
- DRY violations (count of remaining `crate::*` substrate refs).
- Top 3 priorities (strongest stalls with clear design intent).

## Common false-positive patterns (DO NOT report as gaps)

1. **Feature-name-only grep miss** — the primitive IS wired under a different name (struct/function). Always run the struct/function grep (Layer 2).
2. **Bench-only consumer is sufficient** — some primitives (e.g. `future_probe`) ship as benches that validate the primitive; runtime wiring waits for the gate to pass. Mark "Too fresh" not "Stall".
3. **Meta-discipline validators** — `claim_rubric` is CI-time only by design. Its `claim_rubric_bridge.rs` doc-comment says so explicitly. Don't flag.
4. **Opt-in by design** — `closed_unit_compaction` is opt-in because compaction is a sleep-cycle op, not hot path. Don't flag unless the opt-in reason is stale.
5. **Cross-repo transitively** — `subspace_phase_gate` is consumed via riir-neuron-db's freeze gate even though riir-ai runtime doesn't call the diagnostic directly. Mark "Partial" not "Stall".
6. **Fork-drift false WIRED (Issue 019 class)** — Layer 2 struct-name grep hits a file, but Layer 3 reveals the file has zero `use katgpt_*::` imports and defines its own `pub struct SameName`. The primitive is NOT wired — it's locally re-implemented. Report as **Fork drift** (file de-fork task), NOT as WIRED. Without Layer 3, the audit systematically under-counts substrate-side drift in fork-derived repos. Canonical case: `riir-engine/src/transformer/mod.rs` defined local `KVCache`/`KVSnapshot`/`PAGE_SIZE` while `katgpt_transformer::{KVCache, KVSnapshot, PAGE_SIZE}` shipped upstream (the dep was even declared in `Cargo.toml` but unused — `grep "^use katgpt_transformer"` returned 0 matches). Plan 406 Phase 1/2 de-forked these bit-identical and superset types. NOTE (Issue 420, 2026-07-09): a prior version of this example cited `riir-engine/src/kvarn_quality.rs` duplicating `katgpt-kv::kvarn::KvCacheQualityReport` — that was factually wrong (katgpt-kv ships no such type); the riir-engine `KvCacheQualityReport` is a legitimately local `ThinkingController` abstraction, not fork drift.

## The 7-day rule (when a stall becomes actionable)

- **< 7 days default-on:** Too fresh. Note in audit but don't file an issue.
- **7–14 days default-on:** Stall. File issue with wiring plan.
- **> 14 days default-on:** Critical stall. File issue + flag for the next standup.

The 7-day window gives the open primitive time to land its bench evidence before the runtime wiring is expected. It mirrors the "promote-or-demote within one cycle" discipline.
