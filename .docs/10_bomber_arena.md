# microgpt-rs: Bomberman HL Arena — 4-Player Heuristic Learning Proof

## Overview

A headless Bomberman arena using `bevy_ecs` standalone (not the full Bevy engine) for deterministic, tick-based simulation. Four AI players compete at progressively higher HL technology levels, proving that adaptive intelligence outperforms static rules.

The arena serves as the integration test bed for the HL thesis: **bandit-driven action selection + deterministic safety validation > pure heuristics or random baselines**.

## Architecture

### Tick Loop

All systems operate on `&mut World` directly — no ECS schedule, no real-time delta, no plugins.

```text
init_world(seed)
  ├─ ArenaGrid::generate(seed)          → 13×13 procedural grid
  ├─ GameRng, TickCounter, ScoreBoard   → resources
  └─ Events<GameEvent>                  → event bus

spawn_players(world)
  └─ 4 entities at corner spawns with Player, GridPos, BombCount, BombRange, Speed, Alive

run_tick(world, actions) → bool         // returns false when round ends
  ├─ tick_bomb_fuses()                  → countdown, collect expired
  ├─ process_explosions()               → blast propagation (cardinal, wall-blocking)
  ├─ apply_movement()                   → move players, wall/bomb collision
  ├─ place_bombs()                      → spawn bomb entities if action=Bomb
  ├─ collect_powerups()                 → walk over revealed power-ups
  └─ cleanup_and_check()                → kill players in blast, check round end
```

### Event Scoping

Events must be **tick-scoped** for AI decisions and **accumulated** only for end-of-round scoring. The examples use two separate buffers:

```text
tick_events = drain from ECS (this tick only) → passed to select_action()
round_events += tick_events.clone()           → used for final score calculation
```

Accumulating all events and passing them to `select_action` every tick causes `update_bombs()` to replay stale `BombExploded`/`BombPlaced` events, resetting bomb fuses in the AI's model and creating phantom blast zones.

### Grid Layout (13×13)

Standard Bomberman layout generated from seed:
- **Border walls** — fixed perimeter
- **Interior pillars** — fixed walls at even (x, y) intersections
- **Destructible walls** — ~40% fill with hidden power-ups (`BombUp`, `FireUp`, `SpeedUp`)
- **Spawn zones** — 3×3 corners kept clear at (1,1), (11,1), (1,11), (11,11)

## ECS Components & Resources

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `Player { id }` | Player identity (0–3) |
| `GridPos { x, y }` | Position on grid |
| `Bomb`, `BombFuse`, `BombRange` | Bomb entity with countdown and blast radius |
| `BombCount { max, active }` | Per-player bomb limit tracking |
| `Speed { cells_per_tick }` | Movement speed |
| `Alive` | Marker component (removed on death) |
| `DestructibleWall` | Destructible wall entity |
| `PowerUp { kind }` | Collectible power-up |
| `Blast` | Visual blast marker (1-tick lifetime) |

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `ArenaGrid` | 13×13 grid of `Cell` enum |
| `GameRng` | Deterministic seed |
| `TickCounter` | Current tick number |
| `ScoreBoard` | Per-player scores |
| `PlayerEntities` | 4 player `Entity` ids |

## Events

```rust
enum GameEvent {
    PlayerMoved { player, from, to },
    BombPlaced { player, pos },
    BombExploded { pos, range },
    PlayerKilled { victim, killer },
    PowerUpCollected { player, kind },
    PowerUpRevealed { pos, kind },
    WallDestroyed { pos },
    RoundEnd { survivors },
}
```

## Player Types (4 HL Tech Levels)

### P1 🐰 RandomPlayer — Baseline

- **Tech:** None. Random selection from safe moves.
- **Safety:** Avoids walls and known blast zones. Never places bombs.
- **No learning, no memory, no model.** Pure baseline for comparison.

### P2 🐱 GreedyPlayer — Heuristic

- **Tech:** Heuristic scoring of all 6 actions.
- **Selection:** Scores by proximity to power-ups (+3.0 step on, +2.0 toward), wall density (+0.3 per wall in range 3), adjacent wall bonus (+1.0), center bias (+0.2).
- **Safety:** Penalizes blast zones. 20% ε-greedy safe exploration.
- **No opponent tracking, no safety validation.**

### P3 🐶 ValidatorPlayer — Heuristic + Safety Rules

- **Tech:** Same heuristic as P2, plus hard safety validation.
- **Validation rules:**
  - Hard-blocks walking into blast zones (wall-aware blast calculation)
  - Hard-blocks placing bomb with no escape route (BFS checks reachable safe cell)
  - Escape mode when in danger zone (scored by `escape_distance`)
  - Safe mode when clear (full heuristic + safety filter)
- **Tracks:** Known bombs with fuse countdown, revealed power-ups.
- **Limitation:** Static rules prevent suicides but also prevent kills. Too conservative.

### P4 🐵 HLPlayer — Full HL (Heuristic + Attack Tactics + Bandit)

- **Tech:** P3 base + opponent tracking + attack tactics + bandit Q-values + absorb-compress.
- **Tracks:** Known bombs, revealed power-ups, opponent positions with trajectory history.
- **Persists across rounds:** Q-values, visits, compressed arms (bandit memory).

#### FSM Decision Priority (per tick)

| Priority | State | Trigger | Action |
|----------|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | **Evade** | `in_blast_zone(pos)` is true | BFS `escape_distance()` to find safe tile, score movement toward safety (+10.0) |
| 2 | **Wait** | Safe tile, no goals nearby | `BomberAction::Wait` (-1.0 score, hard-blocked if in blast zone) |
| 3 | **Collect** | Revealed power-up visible | Move toward nearest power-up (+3.0 step on, +2.0 toward) |
| 4 | **Attack** | Opponent within range | Intercept predicted path, trap scoring, bomb placement |
| 5 | **Explore** | No threats, no loot, no enemies | Move toward wall-dense areas, center bias, bomb adjacent walls |

#### Attack Tactics

HLPlayer implements four attack functions:

| Function | Purpose | Bonus |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `predict_direction(current, prev)` | Extrapolates opponent heading from position history | feeds into intercept |
| `intercept_score(target, opponent, predicted)` | Move toward opponent's predicted next position | +1.0 toward predicted |
| `count_escape_routes(pos, grid)` | Count walkable neighbors (fewer = better trap) | feeds into trap + chokepoint |
| `trap_score(bomb_pos, opponent, grid, range)` | Score bomb by how trapped opponent would be | +4.0 blast hit, +3.0 dead-end, +2.0 corridor, +1.0 close |
| chokepoint (inline) | Prefer moving where opponent has ≤1 escape route | +1.0 |

#### Opponent Tracking

```rust
type KnownOpponent = (u8, (i32, i32), Option<(i32, i32)>);
//                    id   current_pos   prev_pos (for trajectory)
```

`update_opponents()` stores previous position on each `PlayerMoved` event, enabling `predict_direction()` to extrapolate the opponent's heading.

#### Bandit Layer

- **Blended scoring:** heuristic + strategy bonus (bandit Q-values currently disabled — too sparse at this scale)
- **ε-greedy:** 10% explore, 90% exploit (safe moves only, filtered by blast zone)
- **Absorb-Compress:** Every 100 rounds, arms with `visits ≥ 20 && Q < 0.1` get hard-blocked
- **Reward shaping:** `+1.0 survive, -1.0 die, +0.5 kill, +0.2/powerup`

### P5 🤖 GZeroPlayer — G-Zero Self-Play (Plan 052)

- **Tech:** Weak heuristic + template hints + Hint-δ + DeltaBanditPruner + DeltaGatedAbsorbCompress + HL safety filter.
- **Feature gate:** `--features g_zero` (implies `bandit`, `bomber`)
- **Tracks:** Known bombs, powerups, opponents + template distribution + δ history + bandit Q-values.

#### Decision Flow (per tick)

| Step | Component | What it does |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Weak heuristic | Simple walkability + mild powerup/bomb/center scoring (no BFS escape) |
| 2 | `BomberTemplateProposer` | UCB1 selects from 8 strategy templates (FleeBlast, ChaseNearest, BombWall, etc.) |
| 3 | `hint_score_override` | Template adds ±1-3 to each action score |
| 4 | `HintDelta::compute` | δ = how much template shifted scores vs baseline |
| 5 | Safety filter | When in blast zone → override with `score_action` BFS escape; block moves into blast zones |
| 6 | ε-greedy | 15% random safe exploration |

#### Templates (8 strategy archetypes)

| Template | Hint Effect | When useful |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| FleeBlast | +3.0 away from bombs, -2.0 Bomb/Wait | Bomb-heavy situations |
| ChaseNearest | +2.0 toward closest opponent | Aggressive hunting |
| BombWall | +2.0 near destructible walls | Wall clearing |
| CampCorner | +1.5 corner positions with escape | Defensive play |
| PowerUpHunt | +2.5 toward powerups | Resource collection |
| CutoffOpponent | +2.0 blocking opponent escape | Trapping |
| CenterControl | +1.0 center grid positions | Map control |
| WaitTrap | +1.0 Wait near opponents | Baiting opponents |

#### Key Insight: Safety Filter Dominance

The safety filter (step 5) overrides G-Zero's template decisions in all blast-zone situations. The G-Zero components (Hint-δ, bandit, absorb-compress) influence only **safe, normal moves** — they contribute ±1-3 points on top of the weak baseline. The 64.1% survival rate comes primarily from the HL safety filter + 15% random exploration, not from template intelligence.

### P6 🦊 TftPlayer — Tit-for-Tat (Issue 056)

Game theory's Tit-for-Tat applied to bomberman. 2-state FSM with wall-aware provocation detection.

- **Strategy:** Nice by default (score-based like Greedy). Retaliates when in blast zone + opponent nearby.
- **Retaliation:** Hunt bonus (+1.5), intercept (+1.0), chokepoint (+1.0) — targets nearest opponent.
- **Forgiving:** 10-tick auto-reset timer + 10% generous forgiveness chance.
- **Safety:** Always flees when in blast zone, even in Retaliatory mode.
- **Feature gate:** `--features g_zero` (same as GZero).
- **Mixed tournament result:** 58.4% survival, 3.1 avg score, 0.32 kills/rnd (highest kills, 2nd best score).

## Shared AI Functions (`players.rs`)

These utility functions are used by multiple player types:

| Function | Purpose | Used By |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `in_blast_zone(pos, grid, bombs)` | Check if position is in any bomb's blast (wall-blocking) | All |
| `is_in_single_blast(pos, grid, bomb_pos, range)` | Single bomb blast check with wall blocking | All |
| `escape_distance(pos, grid, bombs, blocked)` | BFS distance to nearest safe cell | Greedy, Validator, HL |

| `is_safe_action(action, grid, pos, bombs)` | Is action safe given bomb state? | Validator, HL |
| `should_place_bomb(grid, pos, bombs)` | Has adjacent wall + escape route? | Greedy, Validator, HL |

## Results

### 100-Round Arena (seed=42)

```text
#1 🐱 Greedy     Score= +171  Wins=5   Deaths=41
#2 🐵 HL         Score= +146  Wins=13  Deaths=43
#3 🐶 Validator  Score=  -23  Wins=1   Deaths=61
#4 🐰 Random     Score=  -43  Wins=12  Deaths=38
```

### 1000-Round Proof (seed=42)

```text
#1 🐵 HL         Survival=7.8%  Score=-0.1  Kills=0.03/rnd
#2 🐰 Random     Survival=4.7%  Score=-0.5  Kills=0.00/rnd
#3 🐱 Greedy     Survival=3.9%  Score=+2.6  Kills=0.39/rnd
#4 🐶 Validator  Survival=0.7%  Score=-0.2  Kills=0.25/rnd
```

**Key Proof:** P4 (HL) survival 7.8% vs P3 (Validator) 0.7% = **+7.1pp** (✅ proven, threshold 5pp).

### Player A/B Benchmark — Isolated Performance + Latency (Plan 054)

Each player type runs as all 4 slots (same type) for 1000 rounds. Measures survival, score, kills, and per-action latency in release mode.

```
Config        │ Survival │ Avg Score │ Avg Kills │ P50 (μs) │ P95 (μs) │ P99 (μs) │ Wins
🐱 Greedy     │   72.1%  │       3.1 │      0.12 │      1.3 │      2.1 │      5.0 │  108
🐶 Validator  │   58.6%  │       1.7 │      0.05 │      1.2 │      1.6 │      2.0 │  292
🐵 HL         │   57.0%  │       2.1 │      0.24 │      0.6 │      1.2 │      2.1 │  222
🤖 GZero      │   64.1%  │       1.8 │      0.06 │      0.5 │      1.0 │      1.5 │  167
```

#### Key Findings

1. **Greedy wins survival** (72.1%) — simplest heuristic is most robust in mirror matches.
2. **GZero > HL** (+7.1pp survival, 0.73× latency) — better at surviving AND faster.
3. **GZero is fastest** (0.5μs P50, 94.6% sub-microsecond) — optimizer inlines template+δ well.
4. **HL most aggressive** (0.24 kills/round) but kills ≠ survival.
5. **Validator worst** (58.6%) — over-conservative safety filter loses positioning.

#### Production Recommendation

| Use Case | Player | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Real-time MMO (lowest latency) | GZero | 0.5μs P50, 94.6% sub-μs, 64.1% survival |
| Survival-focused | Greedy | 72.1% survival, robust heuristic |
| Aggressive/hunt | HL | 0.24 kills/round (but lower survival) |
| Avoid | Validator | Worst survival, no latency advantage |

#### Run the Benchmark

```bash
cargo run -p riir-examples --example g_zero_04_player_ab_benchmark --features g_zero --release
```

### Observations

1. **HL wins most rounds (13/100)** — attack tactics + survival balance makes it the deadliest player.
2. **Greedy has highest score (+171)** — farms power-ups aggressively (3.2/round) but dies more.
3. **Validator is too conservative** — static safety rules prevent suicides but also prevent kills and trap the player in corners.
4. **Random wins via survival** — doesn't hunt or bomb, avoids dangerous situations, outlives aggressive players in chaotic rounds.
5. **Score ≠ Survival** — Greedy optimizes score (power-ups), HL optimizes survival (wins), Random gets lucky.
6. **GZero beats HL in isolation** — weaker baseline + template hints create more robust policy than HL's strategy bonus, AND faster latency.

### TFT Mixed Tournament (Issue 056)

1000-round mixed tournament, release build:

```
Player    │ Survival │ Avg Score │ Avg Kills │ Game Theory Analog
🐱 Greedy │   64.5%  │      3.6  │     0.26  │ Pure Cooperator
🐵 HL     │   60.6%  │      1.7  │     0.00  │ Grim Trigger
🤖 GZero  │   70.5%  │      1.9  │     0.04  │ Noisy Cooperator
🦊 TFT    │   58.4%  │      3.1  │     0.32  │ Tit-for-Tat
```

**Key findings:**
1. **TFT highest kills** (0.32/rnd) — retaliatory mode punishes aggressors.
2. **TFT 2nd best score** (3.1) — Nice mode collects powerups like Greedy.
3. **TFT survival below target** (58.4% < 68% hypothesis) — retaliation bonus pulls toward danger.
4. **FFT is better TFT domain** — `GameEvent::DamageDealt` is crystal-clear signal vs bomber's ambiguous proximity.

Run: `cargo run -p riir-examples --example g_zero_05_tft_mixed --features g_zero --release`

## How to Run

## Replay Training Data Pipeline (Plan 039)

The arena can dump tick-level training data as JSONL for downstream LoRA training in `riir-gpu`.

### Data Flow

```text
bomber_04_replay_gen (1000 rounds)
  │  At each tick, for P3/P4 alive players:
  │    serialize(board_state, action_taken, player_type)
  │
  ▼
output/replays/bomber_replay_{timestamp}.jsonl
  │  Filter: quality > 0.5 (survived/won only)
  │
  ▼
riir-gpu/examples/train_bomber.rs
  │  Loads JSONL → GameSample → wgpu LoRA training
  │
  ▼
output/game_lora.bin → NNPlayer (trained policy adapter)
```

### ReplaySample Format (JSONL)

Each line is one `(board_state, action, quality)` sample:

```json
{
  "board": [0,0,1,2,0,...],
  "player_pos": [3, 5],
  "player_id": 3,
  "bombs": [[3,5,3,8],[7,2,3,4]],
  "powerups": [[10,10],[5,8]],
  "action": 4,
  "quality": 0.85,
  "tick": 42,
  "round": 7,
  "player_type": "HL"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `board` | `Vec<u8>` | 13×13 grid flattened. Floor=0, FixedWall=1, DestructibleWall=2, PowerUpHidden=3 |
| `player_pos` | `[u8; 2]` | Player position (x, y) |
| `player_id` | `u8` | Player index (0-3) |
| `bombs` | `Vec<[u8; 4]>` | Active bombs: (x, y, blast_range, fuse_ticks) |
| `powerups` | `Vec<[u8; 2]>` | Active powerup positions: (x, y) |
| `action` | `u8` | 0=Up, 1=Down, 2=Left, 3=Right, 4=Bomb, 5=Wait |
| `quality` | `f32` | 0.0 (death) → 0.5 (survived) → 1.0 (winner) + bonuses |
| `player_type` | `String` | "Random", "Greedy", "Validator", "HL" |

### Quality Scoring

| Outcome | Base | Bonus |
|---------|------|-------|
| Death | 0.0 | — |
| Survived | 0.5 | +0.05/powerup (cap +0.2), +0.1/kill (cap +0.3) |
| Winner | 1.0 | +0.05/powerup (cap +0.2), +0.1/kill (cap +0.3) |

## Design Lessons

1. **Event scoping matters** — accumulating events across ticks poisons AI state; tick-scoped events for decisions, accumulated only for scoring.
2. **ConstraintPruner is domain-agnostic** — same `is_safe_action` pattern serves both Bomberman blast zones and Sudoku rule validation.
3. **Wall-aware blast calculation is essential** — naive range checks without wall blocking create phantom danger zones.
4. **Trajectory prediction > reactive tracking** — extrapolating opponent heading from position history enables interception.
5. **Static safety can be counterproductive** — Validator's hard blocks prevent all suicides but also prevent strategic risk-taking that wins games.
6. **Attack tactics are additive** — hunt, intercept, chokepoint, and trap scoring compose cleanly on top of the base heuristic.
