//! Coordinate-fold unlinking correction (paper §5, Eq. 1) — hot-path, zero-alloc.
//!
//! The paper proves (Theorem 4.7) that width-d feedforward nets with
//! coordinate-wise monotonic activations preserve the linking number and
//! therefore cannot linearly separate linked manifolds. The escape is a
//! **fold**: a coordinate-wise map with a strict local extremum, such as
//! `|x|`, GELU, Swish, or Mish. A ResNet block realizes `|x|` exactly via
//! the identity `|x| = x + 2·ReLU(−x)` (Eq. 1) — one residual block with a
//! monotonic ReLU + skip is enough to break the homotopy-preservation
//! argument that underlies the impossibility theorem.
//!
//! This module ships the modelless fold as an in-place latent correction.
//! When [`super::linking_detector::detect_linking`] fires (two latent
//! clusters are topologically linked), apply one coordinate-fold pass per
//! axis to unlink them before the monotonic projection. The fold is:
//!
//! - **Closed-form**: `state[i] ← center[i] + |state[i] − center[i]|` (Abs
//!   variant), or a smooth GELU-surrogate with a local minimum (Gelu variant).
//! - **Zero-allocation, `#[inline]`**: hot-path, per-tick safe.
//! - **Deterministic**: bit-identical given the same input + center.
//!
//! # Why this is §3.5 path-3 (latent-space correction), not riir-train
//!
//! The fold is the modelless analog of a trained adapter that fixes a
//! systematic, characterizable bias ("two classes are linked"). Instead of
//! learning the correction via gradient descent, it is derived in closed
//! form from the failure mode (Lemma C.7: monotonic activations preserve
//! link via straight-line homotopy; a fold breaks the homotopy by creating
//! a collision line). This is exactly the case the modelless-unblock
//! protocol (AGENTS.md §3.5) prefers over riir-train deferral.

/// Hard coordinate-fold: `state[i] ← center[i] + |state[i] − center[i]|`.
///
/// This is the paper's `|x| = x + 2·ReLU(−x)` (Eq. 1) realized as a single
/// fold per coordinate, applied in-place. After one pass per axis (three
/// passes for R^3, paper Fig. 9), a linked pair of manifolds becomes
/// linearly separable.
///
/// The fold reflects the input across `center` on each axis, collapsing
/// the negative half-line onto the positive one. For a Hopf link where the
/// two components occupy complementary half-spaces (e.g. X near x=0 plane,
/// Y near y=0 plane), folding both onto the positive octant makes them
/// disjoint and convexly separable.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// - `state`: flat `[x_0, x_1, ..., x_{d-1}]` latent vector, modified in-place.
/// - `center`: the fold center `c`; same length as `state`. Pass a zero
///   slice for the canonical `|x|` fold (reflects across the origin).
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Panics (debug builds only) if `state.len() != center.len()`. In release
/// the shorter slice determines the fold count — caller's contract.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use katgpt_core::linking_fold::fold_projection_into;
/// // Fold a 3D vector onto the positive octant.
/// let mut state = [-1.0_f32, 0.5, -0.25];
/// let center = [0.0_f32; 3];
/// fold_projection_into(&mut state, &center);
/// assert_eq!(state, [1.0, 0.5, 0.25]);
/// ```

/// Smoothed `|x|` via a multiquadric-bump surrogate (paper §F.2).
///
/// The paper's impossibility theorem (Thm 4.7) depends only on monotonicity,
/// not on the specific form of the activation. Any activation with a strict
/// local extremum on an open interval breaks the straight-line homotopy
/// argument (Lemma C.7) the same way `|·|` does. GELU `x·Φ(x)` has a local
/// minimum near `x ≈ −0.753...`; Swish `x·σ(x)` near `x ≈ −1.278...`; Mish
/// near a similar point. The construction (paper §F.2, Example 5.1) is:
///
/// 1. Rescale the data coordinate into the local-extremum interval via an
///    affine pre-shift.
/// 2. Apply the non-monotonic activation — it folds the data the same way
///    `|·|` does, just smoothly.
///
/// This function returns a single-coordinate smoothed `|x|`-surrogate:
/// `gelu_smoothed_abs(x, alpha)` ≈ `|x|` for large `|x|`, but with a smooth
/// V-shape near the origin instead of a hard kink. The `alpha` parameter
/// controls the smoothness (larger → sharper, → hard `|x|` as `alpha → ∞`).
///
/// The formula is `sqrt(x² + alpha⁻²) − alpha⁻¹` (a smoothed absolute value,
/// the multiquadric-bump analogue of `|x|`). It is everywhere differentiable,
/// has a strict local minimum at `x = 0`, and converges to `|x| − alpha⁻¹`
/// as `|x| → ∞`. The `−alpha⁻¹` offset is removed so the minimum is exactly 0.
///
/// This is a generic smoothed-abs surrogate, not GELU itself — GELU's local
/// minimum is asymmetric and only exists on the negative side, which makes
/// it unsuitable as a direct symmetric `|x|` replacement. The multiquadric
/// surrogate is symmetric, everywhere-smooth, and has the right large-`|x|`
/// asymptote.
