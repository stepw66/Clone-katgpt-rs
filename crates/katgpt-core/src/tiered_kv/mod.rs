//! Tiered Hot/Warm/Cold K/V Store — the route-and-fetch substrate for
//! sparse long-context attention (Plan 397, Research 379).
//!
//! Distilled from Frank, Fedosov, Grinenko (BMW Group) 2026, *"Hierarchical
//! Global Attention"* ([arxiv 2606.30709](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.30709)).
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! A generic abstraction for a 3-temperature K/V store that lets a sparse
//! attention primitive fetch only the routed working set from a tiered backing
//! store, instead of materializing the entire historical K/V cache.
//!
//! - **Hot** — always-resident: chunk/group summaries + sink chunk + local window.
//!   Small (summaries are sub-chunk centroids; sink+local are bounded windows).
//! - **Warm** — bounded LRU shard cache for recently-routed token chunks.
//! - **Cold** — full token K/V in process RAM (reference impl). Production
//!   mmap/NVMe-backed variant is a riir-ai/riir-neuron-db follow-up.
//!
//! The trait is intentionally generic over `D` (head dim) and does not mandate
//! RoPE, entmax, or any attention-specific policy — the routing decision is
//! made by the caller (e.g. HGA's `forward_hga`), the store only fetches.
//!
//! # Why always-on (not feature-gated)
//!
//! `TieredKvStore` is a generic trait + reference impl with no attention-layer
//! dependencies. It's useful for any future route-and-fetch pattern, not just
//! HGA. Keep it ungated; the HGA-specific code that consumes it is gated by `hga`.
