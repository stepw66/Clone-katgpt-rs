//! State-Action Pair Cache for MCTS over Deterministic Inference Actions.
//!
//! Distilled from **UnMaskFork** (Misaki & Akiba, Sakana AI, Feb 2026,
//! [arXiv:2602.04344](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04344)) — test-time scaling for
//! masked diffusion via deterministic action branching. This module is the
//! open, modelless, game-IP-free half of the primitive: a lock-free
//! `StateActionCache` keyed on `(blake3::Hash, InferenceAction)` pairs, plus a
//! generic [`mcts_search_with_state_action_cache`] entry point that
//! consults/inserts the cache at Expand time.
//!
//! # Why this exists (vs the shipped `mcts` substrate)
//!
//! The existing [`crate::mcts`] module is generic over [`crate::traits::GameState`]
//! and caches at the **state** granularity (transposition). It cannot represent
//! the "same state, *different deterministic action*, different transition"
//! axis that UnMaskFork exploits: when transitions are deterministic
//! (`Var[R | s, a] = 0`), the pair `(state, action)` uniquely determines the
//! next state and reward, so revisiting that pair is a zero-cost cache hit.
//! State-only caches lose this because two actions at the same state collide
//! on the state key.
//!
//! # The DeterministicTransition contract (load-bearing)
//!
//! **The caller MUST guarantee that for any fixed `(state, action)`, applying
//! `action` to `state` yields a unique `(next_state, reward)`.** Concretely:
//! the `InferenceActionSpace::apply` function must be a pure function of
//! `(state, action)` — no internal RNG, no thread-local drift, no
//! wall-clock-dependent tie-breaking.
//!
//! Violations cause stale cache hits: a later visit to `(s, a)` reads the
//! `(s', r)` recorded by an earlier visit, even though re-applying `a` to `s`
//! would now produce a different result. The Phase 2 debug-mode re-check
//! ([`StateActionCache::verify_determinism`]) detects such drift empirically,
//! but the contract itself is trusted in release builds (the re-check is a
//! diagnostic, not a correctness backstop).
//!
//! # Theoretical motivation — UnMaskFork Eq. 1
//!
//! Let `ε_a(z)` be the kernel error of action `a` on state `z`. Then:
//!
//! ```text
//!   Σ_z min_a ε_a(z)  ≤  min_a Σ_z ε_a(z)
//!      (switching)         (single best static)
//! ```
//!
//! The left-hand side is the error of a *state-dependent switching* policy
//! (pick the best action per state); the right-hand side is the error of the
//! best *single static* action applied everywhere. The inequality holds
//! pointwise (the per-state min dominates any fixed choice) and is **strict**
//! whenever no single action dominates in every state — which is exactly the
//! case UnMaskFork's dLLM-unmasking case study exhibits (different remasking
//! strategies win at different mask ratios). The cache is what makes the
//! switching policy budget-cheap: once `(s, a) → (s', r)` is recorded, the
//! switch costs zero NFE.
//!
//! See `.research/386_*.md` §1.4 for the full derivation and the Phase 2
//! property test (`tests/mcts_state_action_cache_eq1.rs`) for an empirical
//! check on a synthetic landscape.
//!
//! # vs state-only transposition (Plan 061 / Plan 388)
//!
//! Neither [`crate`] `TranspositionTable` nor `ProofGoalCache` is deprecated —
//! they remain the right tool when the action axis is irrelevant (single-action
//! search, or when actions are stochastic so `(s, a)` does NOT determine `s'`).
//! This module generalizes both to the `(state, action)` key for the
//! deterministic-transition regime.
