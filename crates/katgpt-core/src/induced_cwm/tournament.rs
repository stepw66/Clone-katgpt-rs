//! Value Function Tournament over an induced CWM (Plan 296 Phase 3).
//!
//! Paper §4.4 + §C (arxiv 2510.04542): once an induced CWM is verifiable and
//! committable, the play-strength GOAT gate (G2') needs a way to *select*
//! among candidate value functions (heuristics). The paper uses an
//! arena-play tournament — round-robin matches with a fixed baseline — and
//! ranks candidates by win-rate-vs-baseline, tie-broken by head-to-head.
//!
//! This module ships the **generic, IP-free half** of that idea:
//!
//! - [`ValueFnTournament`] — round-robin arena-play selector over
//!   [`StateHeuristic`] candidates.
//! - [`PlayerStats`] — per-candidate win/loss/draw + avg reward.
//! - [`TournamentWinner`] — wrapper around the winning candidate + full
//!   ranking, returned from [`ValueFnTournament::run`].
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! 1. Each candidate heuristic `H_i` is wrapped into an MCTS-based policy
//!    `policy_i(state, pid) -> Action` that uses `H_i.evaluate(...)` as the
//!    MCTS leaf evaluation.
//! 2. For every candidate `i`:
//!    - Play `games_per_match` games as player 0 vs `baseline`, with the
//!      candidate moving first; then `games_per_match` games as player 1,
//!      with the baseline moving first.
//!    - Record wins/losses/draws and cumulative reward into `PlayerStats[i]`.
//! 3. Round-robin: for every pair `(i, j)`, `i != j`, play
//!    `games_per_match` games head-to-head (each candidate moves first in
//!    half the games). Record into a separate head-to-head matrix.
//! 4. Winner = highest win-rate-vs-baseline; tie-break by head-to-head
//!    win-rate.
//!
//! The baseline is a plain closure `Fn(&S, u8) -> S::Action` so callers can
//! plug in random play, a fixed policy, or a heuristic-of-record. The
//! tournament measures "MCTS-with-heuristic-H vs baseline" — i.e. it
//! isolates the *heuristic*'s contribution to play strength, since every
//! candidate uses the same search budget and the same induced CWM.
//!
//! # Self-containment (mirrors Phase 2)
//!
//! This module lives in `katgpt-core`, so it CANNOT import
//! `katgpt-rs/src/pruners/game_state/mcts.rs` (the root crate depends on
//! `katgpt-core`, which would be a circular dep — same constraint Phase 2's
//! ISMCTS hit). A minimal MCTS is mirrored here. It is intentionally simpler
//! than the root `mcts_search`: no transposition table, no warm-start. The
//! tournament only needs *relative* play strength between heuristics, so
//! absolute search quality is irrelevant as long as it's held constant
//! across candidates.
//!
//! # Deviation from Plan 296 §T3.1
//!
//! The plan signature was:
//! ```text
//! pub fn run<K: InducedCwmKernel>(&self, kernel: &K, baseline: ...) -> TournamentWinner<V>
//! ```
//! Dropped the `kernel: &K` parameter — it's redundant with `initial_state:
//! &S` because under the codebase's `GameState` convention (Phase 1 T1.6
//! deviation), the state IS the kernel. `S: InducedCwmKernel` is the type
//! bound; the *value* of `initial_state` is what gets cloned to start each
//! match. Matches Phase 1's `verify_transition(test: &TransitionUnitTest<S>)`
//! and Phase 2's `ismcts_search_with_inference<S, B>(...)` shape.
//!
//! # Latent vs raw boundary (AGENTS.md)
//!
//! - `StateHeuristic::evaluate(...)` outputs are scalar (raw) — they cross
//!   no sync boundary because the whole tournament is offline / search-local.
//! - The chosen `S::Action` per playout is raw and (in principle) syncable.
//! - `PlayerStats` and `TournamentWinner` are search-local scratch — they
//!   are not synced. They may be *logged* (audit cadence) for the GOAT gate
//!   proof file.
