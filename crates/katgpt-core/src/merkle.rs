//! Merkle octree — hierarchical BLAKE3 commitment for KG latent octree nodes.
//!
//! Depth-3 octree = 73 nodes: 1 root + 8 internal + 64 leaves.
//! Each node stores a `[u8; 32]` BLAKE3 hash.
//! Feature-gated behind `merkle_octree`.
//!
//! ## Co-extraction provenance (Plan 338 Phase 2.5)
//!
//! The Merkle octree surface (constants + `MerkleOctree` + `MerkleProof` +
//! impls) was promoted to `katgpt_types::merkle` so the promoted
//! `katgpt-sense` crate (which uses `build_with_merkle` in `octree.rs`)
//! can depend on the leaf only, breaking the katgpt-core cycle. This file is
//! now a thin re-export shim — `katgpt_core::merkle::*` paths are preserved
//! bit-for-bit. Tests stay here and exercise the surface through the
//! re-export.
