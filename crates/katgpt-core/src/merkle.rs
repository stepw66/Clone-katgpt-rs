//! Merkle octree — hierarchical BLAKE3 commitment for KG latent octree nodes.
//!
//! Depth-3 octree = 73 nodes: 1 root + 8 internal + 64 leaves.
//! Each node stores a `[u8; 32]` BLAKE3 hash.
//! Feature-gated behind `merkle_octree`.
//!
//! Layout (index-based, bottom-up construction):
//! ```text
//! Index 0:         root
//! Index 1..=8:     internal nodes (8)
//! Index 9..=72:    leaf nodes (64)
//! ```
//!
//! For node at index `i`:
//! - Children start at `i * 8 + 1` (if within bounds)
//! - Parent is `(i - 1) / 8`
//!
//! Plan 221-M Phase 1: T1 (MerkleOctree), T3 (MerkleProof).
