//! Renoise-CE self-verifier — perturb a completed state, re-resolve through
//! the same operator, measure drift as a verifier-free correctness score.
//!
//! Distilled from Flow Reasoning Models (Helbling et al., arXiv:2606.29150).
//! Research note: [`katgpt-rs/.research/369_Flow_Reasoning_Models_Renoise_CE_Self_Verifier.md`].
//! Plan: [`katgpt-rs/.plans/406_renoise_ce_self_verifier.md`].
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! A **modelless, operator-agnostic self-evaluation signal**: given a completed
//! candidate state `y`, perturb it (add noise / mask / domain-specific
//! corruption), re-resolve through the same operator `F`, and measure the
//! cross-entropy drift `d(y, F(perturb(y)))`. Correct solutions sit in stable
//! basins of the operator's dynamics → low drift. Confident mistakes sit in
//! spurious basins → high drift under perturbation. The drift IS the verifier
//! score — no external verifier, no labels, no auxiliary head.
//!
//! This is the **third orthogonal self-eval signal** alongside CLR (claim-level
//! vote, R255/P284) and CoE (trajectory geometry, R345/P342):
//! - CLR asks "do the claims check out"
//! - CoE asks "is the trajectory shape committed"
//! - Renoise-CE asks "is the output a stable fixed point under perturbation"
//!
//! # What this is NOT
//!
//! - **NOT a UQ primitive.** Returns a raw drift score (lower = more stable),
//!   not a calibrated probability. Any UQ claim (correctness probability,
//!   confidence interval) MUST be conformal-wrapped and beat the floor
//!   (`ConformalIntervalCalibrator<SeasonalNaiveForecaster>`, Plan 340 / Issue
//!   010). Until then, it is a **ranking signal**.
//! - **NOT a refinement step.** Unlike Q-Sample (Plan 222) which re-noises to
//!   drive toward a *better* answer, renoise-CE re-noises to *score* the
//!   current answer. The candidate is returned unchanged.
//! - **NOT the same-input comparison of Self-Advantage Gate** (Plan 283).
//!   Renoise-CE PERTURBS the input; Self-Advantage compares the same input
//!   across two passes.
//!
//! # Hot-path design
//!
//! - `RenoiseCeScore::per_draw` is a fixed `[f32; 8]` — zero allocation on the
//!   score path.
//! - `perturb` operates in-place on a cloned state (one alloc per draw,
//!   unavoidable — the caller's state must not be mutated).
//! - `re_resolve` returns an owned state.
//! - The score loop reuses a single accumulator.
//!
//! # RNG
//!
//! Uses `fastrand::Rng` (codebase convention). The trait is generic over
//! `fastrand::Rng` directly (not `impl rand::Rng`) to match the rest of
//! katgpt-core. Callers construct one with `fastrand::Rng::with_seed(...)`
//! for determinism.
