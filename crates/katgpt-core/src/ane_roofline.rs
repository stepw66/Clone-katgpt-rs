//! ANE-aware roofline cost model — extends [`crate::roofline`] with the Apple
//! Neural Engine's distinct cost shape.
//!
//! *Source:* Bryngelson, *Apple Neural Engine: Architecture, Programming, and
//! Performance*, arXiv:2606.22283 (2026). See `katgpt-rs/.research/377_*.md`
//! and `katgpt-rs/.plans/379_*.md`.
//!
//! # Why a separate model from [`crate::roofline`]
//!
//! The GPU roofline in [`crate::roofline`] models three regimes:
//! `Launch / Compute / Memory`. The ANE has two extra regimes that the GPU
//! model does not capture, both of which produce wrong routing decisions if
//! ignored:
//!
//! 1. **Working-set cliff** — operands larger than the on-chip SRAM (2 MB on
//!    M1/H13, 4.72 MB on M5/H17s, see Bryngelson ch. 9.2 / ch. 21.1, HAL
//!    field `0x1b8`) are tiled and streamed from DRAM, collapsing arithmetic
//!    intensity. This is a hard cliff, not a soft slope.
//! 2. **Family-floor capability gate** — operations declare a
//!    `MinimumFamily<N>` trait (Bryngelson ch. 35); an op with floor F3
//!    (e.g. crop-resize) does not lower on M1/A13 and must run on CPU/GPU.
//!
//! The ANE also has a **much higher dispatch floor** than a GPU kernel launch:
//! 0.23 ms on M1 vs ~50 µs for a typical GPU kernel (see [`HardwarePeaks`]).
//! Below that floor the operation pays the full round-trip regardless of how
//! little compute it does, so the CPU almost always wins for small work.
//!
