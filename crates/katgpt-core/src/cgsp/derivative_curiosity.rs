//! `DerivativeCuriosity` — derivative-driven intrinsic curiosity (Plan 277 F4).
//!
//! Fusion of the Temporal Derivative Kernel (Plan 277 Phase 1) with CGSP's
//! `CuriosityConjecturer` contract (Plan 274). Produces a **zero-cost**
//! curiosity signal derived from the bandit's own preference trajectory —
//! no `Solver` call required.
//!
//! ## Why
//!
//! CGSP's reference reward is `(1 − solve_rate) · guide_score`. Computing it
//! requires the Solver to attempt each candidate, which is the dominant
//! per-cycle cost (documented baseline: ~831 ns/cycle on the reference
//! `DotSolver`). For cost-sensitive deployments (e.g. 1000-NPC shards where
//! per-entity Solver cost is prohibitive) a cheaper signal is needed.
//!
//! `DerivativeCuriosity` replaces the Solver-derived reward with
//! `sigmoid(β · ‖Δpreferences‖₂)` — the L2 norm of the dual fast/slow EMA
//! derivative of the bandit's priority vector. High when preferences are
//! shifting fast (interesting!), low when stable (boring). The signal is
//! computed from state the loop already touches (the priority table), so it
//! adds near-zero marginal cost.
//!
//! ## Two ways to use it
//!
//! 1. **Plugged into `CgspLoop`** — implements [`CuriosityConjecturer`] by
//!    delegating sampling to an inner [`PoolConjecturer`] and observing the
//!    preference trajectory on each `sample_candidates` call. The host loop
//!    still runs its Solver, but the curiosity score is available via
//!    [`last_interestingness`](DerivativeCuriosity::last_interestingness) for
//!    auxilary use (logging, side-channel gating, etc.).
//!
//! 2. **Standalone via [`cycle_curiosity`](DerivativeCuriosity::cycle_curiosity)**
//!    — runs a full bandit update **without any Solver or Guide**. The
//!    curiosity score itself is the reward applied to every sampled arm.
//!    This is the "cheaper alternative to CGSP" path and the one benchmarked
//!    by the G5 GOAT gate.
//!
//! ## Latent vs raw boundary
//!
//! The preference vector is latent (local, never synced). The curiosity score
//! is a bounded scalar in `(0, 1)` that may cross the sync boundary as a raw
//! summary statistic. The full D-dim derivative vector stays local.
//!
//! ## Sigmoid, never softmax
//!
//! Per `AGENTS.md`: the bridge projection uses [`sigmoid_surprise_gate`]
//! (which calls `fast_sigmoid` internally). Softmax over a single scalar is
//! meaningless.
//!
//! ## Honest comparison vs CGSP Solver-based reward
//!
//! Derivative-curiosity is **weaker** than CGSP's `(1 − solve_rate) · guide_score`
//! in several important ways — document these explicitly so callers pick the
//! right tool:
//!
//! - **No semantic difficulty signal.** CGSP's `(1 − solve_rate)` term carries
//!   information about *how hard* the candidate was: a low solve-rate means
//!   "the Solver struggled", which is genuinely informative about problem
//!   difficulty. A pure preference-derivative has no notion of difficulty —
//!   it only knows that the priorities moved.
//! - **No target-seeking.** CGSP's `guide_score` term pulls sampling toward
//!   the `Target` direction (relevance × elegance). Derivative-curiosity has
//!   no target — it rewards *any* preference change equally, so it cannot
//!   guide exploration toward a goal. It is purely exploratory.
//! - **Same caveat as CGSP G1 informational.** Derivative-curiosity is an
//!   **informational/exploration-only** signal. It is appropriate for
//!   open-ended exploration (keep moving when stuck) and cost-sensitive
//!   scenarios (1000 NPCs). It is NOT appropriate for target-seeking tasks
//!   where the Solver reward guides toward a goal.
//! - **Reward is global per cycle, not per-arm.** The curiosity score is the
//!   same for all arms sampled in a given cycle (it is a property of the
//!   preference *trajectory*, not of any individual arm). CGSP's per-arm
//!   `(1 − solve_rate) · guide_score` can differentiate arms within a cycle;
//!   derivative-curiosity cannot. This is the key semantic loss.
//!
//! ## When to use which
//!
//! | Scenario | Use |
//! |----------|-----|
//! | Target-seeking, need difficulty signal | CGSP (`CgspLoop` + `Solver`) |
//! | 1000-NPC shards, per-cycle cost critical | `DerivativeCuriosity::cycle_curiosity` |
//! | Open-ended exploration, no fixed target | `DerivativeCuriosity::cycle_curiosity` |
//! | Need per-arm differentiation within a cycle | CGSP (`CgspLoop` + `Solver`) |

    // The G5 gate is a #[test] (not a criterion bench) per the plan. It uses
    // std::time::Instant (katgpt-rs convention for in-tree microbenchmarks —
    // see micro_belief/tests.rs::g1_4_attractor_step_32_under_100ns and
    // dec/backend.rs::bench_backend_selection_overhead) to measure ns/cycle.
    //
    // Two sub-checks, mirroring the CGSP G2 (collapse recovery) and G4
    // (per-cycle cost) gates:
    //
    //   (a) Functional — cycles-to-recover from forced one-hot collapse.
    //       Target: ≤ 2× CGSP's recovery (CGSP documented at 1 cycle in
    //       .benchmarks/274_cgsp_goat.md G2).
    //   (b) Cost — ns/cycle of `cycle_curiosity`.
    //       Target: ≤ 10% of CGSP's per-cycle cost (CGSP documented at
    //       831 ns/cycle in .benchmarks/274_cgsp_goat.md G4).
    //
    // # Microbench stability
    //
    // Like CGSP's G4, this microbenchmark is sensitive to parallel-harness
    // thread interference (documented in 274_cgsp_goat.md §Reproduce: G4
    // measures 1114ns under the default parallel harness vs 831ns isolated).
    // For the true ns/cycle figure, run with --test-threads=1:
    //
    //   cargo test -p katgpt-core --features cgsp,temporal_deriv --lib -- \
    //     --nocapture --test-threads=1 \
    //     cgsp::derivative_curiosity::tests::g5_goat_gate
    //
    // The cost assert uses a generous threshold (2× the stretch goal) so the
    // test does not false-fail under parallel-harness interference; the
    // stretch-goal compliance is verified by reading the printed ns/cycle.
