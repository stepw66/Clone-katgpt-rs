//! RTDC — Resolution-Tiered Deterministic Commitment.
//!
//! Wraps the existing `MerkleOctree` (Plan 253) with per-depth roots aligned
//! to SLoD (Plan 235) σ-boundaries. Each depth corresponds to an abstraction
//! level, so a curator at distance d* can verify inclusion at the abstraction
//! level it actually operates at, with proof size shrinking at coarser depths.
//!
//! ## Capability
//!
//! **Trust-minimized semantic zoom.** A light client cryptographically
//! verifies its fog-of-war view is a faithful sub-summation of the
//! chain-committed full KG, with O(log n) BLAKE3 proof at the abstraction
//! level it operates at — no full-KG download, no trust in the serving node.
//!
//! ## Phase 1 (this module)
//!
//! - 3 deterministic roots derived from the octree: depth-0 (global),
//!   depth-1 (regional, 8 internal nodes), depth-2 (fine, 64 leaves).
//! - `DepthTieredMerkleOctree::build` consumes a `MerkleOctree` and
//!   `&[ScaleBoundary]` (≥2 boundaries required).
//! - `prove_at_depth(d=2)` is fully sound (full Merkle path, 14 siblings).
//! - `prove_at_depth(d=1)` reconstructs the parent internal node hash from
//!   7 leaf-level siblings; soundness that this internal is in `roots[1]`
//!   requires the Phase 2 `subtree_inclusion` proof.
//! - `prove_at_depth(d=0)` returns a trivial proof; full soundness also
//!   requires Phase 2.
//! - `DeterministicLeafEncode` trait — the encoding contract for
//!   cross-platform bit-identical leaf hashing.
//!
//! ## What Phase 1 does NOT deliver
//!
//! - Cross-depth consistency proof (`subtree_inclusion`) — Candidate C
//!   (probabilistic sampling) shipped behind `rtdc_subtree_inclusion`;
//!   Candidate A (Pedersen deterministic) research closed dormant, see
//!   `riir-chain/.research/006_RTDC_Candidate_A_Pedersen_Resolution.md`.
//! - LatCal-backed `DeterministicLeafEncode` impl — lives in riir-chain
//!   (Plan 003, gated on this module's trait existing).
//! - Chain quorum over 3 roots — riir-chain Plan 003.
//!
//! Plan 302 Phase 1 (T1.1–T1.6). Open primitive, public MIT.
