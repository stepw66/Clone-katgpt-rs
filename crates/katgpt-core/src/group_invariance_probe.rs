//! Group Invariance Probe — modelless symmetry discovery on a hypothesis Lie group.
//!
//! Distilled from LieFlow (Chen et al., arXiv:2512.20043, ICML 2026; see
//! `katgpt-rs/.research/355_LieFlow_Symmetry_Discovery_Group_Orbit_Support.md`).
//! The paper's trained flow-matching velocity field `v_θ` redirects to
//! riir-train; what ships here is the **deterministic invariance test** +
//! **support-concentration classifier** — the modelless residue that
//! generalizes [`crate::subspace_phase_gate`] from "subspace of `ℝᵈ`" to
//! "subgroup of a hypothesis group `G`".
//!
//! # The reframe (one sentence)
//!
//! LieFlow discovers a symmetry group `H ⊆ G` by learning a distribution
//! over `G` whose **support concentrates on `H`**: continuous `H` spreads
//! smoothly over a submanifold, discrete `H` peaks sharply at the finite
//! group elements. We replace "learn a distribution via trained flow
//! matching" with "**score each sampled `g ∈ G` by direct invariance
//! testing**, then read `H` off the score histogram's concentration".
//!
//! # What this computes
//!
//! Given:
//! - a hypothesis matrix Lie group `G` (via the [`GroupAction`] trait),
//! - an observation summary `q ∈ ℝᵈ` (mean trajectory, `style_weights`, ...),
//! - a distribution distance `d(q, g·q)` (caller-supplied via a closure),
//! - a sharpness `β` and a support threshold `τ`,
//!
//! the probe computes `invariance_score(g) = σ(β·(1 − d(q, g·q)))` for
//! each sampled `g`, then classifies the discovered subgroup `H`:
//!
//! ```text
//! Discrete   ⟺  score_concentration < τ_disc   (peaked: few g's near 1, rest near 0)
//! Continuous ⟺  score_concentration ≥ τ_cont   (spread: many g's with similar score)
//! Partial    ⟺  mixed (bimodal but no clean peak)
//! None       ⟺  all scores near 0 (no non-trivial invariance)
//! ```
//!
//! # Why this is NOT redundant with [`crate::subspace_phase_gate`]
//!
//! `subspace_phase_gate` answers "is the data concentrated in a *linear
//! subspace* of `ℝᵈ`?" via participation ratio / numerical rank. It cannot
//! tell "uniform on a group orbit" (a 1-D submanifold of `SO(2)`, e.g.
//! uniform on the circle) from "no structure" (i.i.d. Gaussian) — both
//! have participation ratio ≈ ambient dim. The group invariance probe
//! answers the *different* question "is the data invariant under a
//! *subgroup* of `G`?" by testing `d(q, g·q)` directly. The two are
//! orthogonal: a dataset can be subgroup-invariant without being
//! low-rank (uniform on `SO(2)` is full-rank but `SO(2)`-invariant).
//!
//! # Performance contract
//!
//! - [`invariance_score`]: O(1), one sigmoid.
//! - [`score_concentration`]: O(n) on a length-n score slice, zero-alloc,
//!   chunk-4 accumulation (mirrors [`crate::participation_ratio`]'s loop shape).
//! - [`classify_subgroup`]: O(n), zero-alloc, one [`score_concentration`]
//!   call plus a support-fraction scan.
//! - [`discover_subgroup_into`]: O(n_samples · cost(distance_fn)),
//!   zero-alloc after scratch init. The caller supplies `&mut [f32]`
//!   scratch for the per-sample scores and the rotated query buffer.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! All operations are deterministic and platform-independent (pure float
//! arithmetic, no SIMD dispatch inside the math, no floating-point
//! reordering). Required for anti-cheat: a discovered-subgroup
//! classification that crosses the sync boundary (as a `u8` tag, see
//! [`SubgroupClass::as_u8`]) must be bit-identical across quorum nodes.
//!
//! # Feature gate
//!
//! `group_invariance_probe` — opt-in. Pure numeric substrate, no extra
//! deps. Sibling of `subspace_phase_gate`.

// ── Invariance score ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/// The per-element invariance score `σ(β·(1 − d))`.
///
/// Returns ≈ `1.0` when the normalized distance `d` is 0 (perfect
/// invariance under `g`), `0.5` when `d = 1` (the midpoint / indifference
/// point), and asymptotes to `0.0` as `d → ∞`. `β` controls sharpness:
/// higher `β` → sharper transition between "invariant" and "not invariant".
///
/// **Normalization convention:** the caller MUST normalize `d` so that the
/// "indifference" distance (where the score is exactly 0.5) maps to `d = 1`.
/// For L2 distances in `[0, d_max]`, divide by `d_max / 2`. For cosine
/// distance in `[0, 2]`, divide by 2. The recommended default is `β = 10.0`
/// which gives σ(10) ≈ 0.99995 at d=0 and σ(−10) ≈ 4.5e-5 at d=2.
///
/// This is a **shifted sigmoid** (not softmax, not RBF): `σ(β·(1−d))`. It
/// is the standard distance-to-affinity mapping that hits 1.0 at d=0 while
/// staying within the sigmoid family per the codebase convention. The
/// shift by 1 (rather than 0) is what distinguishes "perfectly invariant"
/// (d=0, score≈1) from "indifferent" (d=1, score=0.5) — without the shift,
/// `σ(−β·d)` would give 0.5 at d=0, conflating perfect invariance with
/// indifference.

// ── Score variance (the discrete-vs-continuous classifier) ───────────────

/// Population variance of the invariance-score histogram.
///
/// Returns `f32 ∈ [0, 0.25]` for scores in `[0, 1]`:
/// - `≈ 0.25` — **maximally bimodal** (half scores near 1, half near 0)
///   → `Discrete`. A perfect `C_n` subgroup with `n/|G| = 0.5` lands here.
/// - `≈ 0.083` — **uniform spread** (`1/12`, all scores similar but varied)
///   → `Continuous`.
/// - `≈ 0` — **degenerate** (all scores identical: either all-1 for `H=G`
///   or all-0 for no symmetry).
///
/// This is the primary discrete-vs-continuous discriminator. It
/// distinguishes "sharp peaks separated by zero-score regions" (discrete:
/// high variance) from "smooth gradient" (continuous: low-to-moderate
/// variance). The participation-ratio-style [`score_concentration`] cannot
/// make this distinction when the discrete subgroup is a large fraction of
/// the hypothesis group (e.g. `C₄ ⊂ C₈` has concentration 0.5, identical to
/// a uniform spread at 50% support).

/// treating `s_i ∈ [0,1]` as a (non-negative) "energy", compute
/// `concentration = (Σ s_i)² / (n · Σ s_i²)`. This is exactly

/// It equals `1.0` when all scores are equal (perfect spread) and
/// `≈ 1/k` when exactly `k` scores are `1` and the rest are `0` (perfect
/// `k`-peak discrete support).
