//! Plan 390 Phase 2 T2.1 — UnMaskFork Eq. 1 property test.
//!
//! Verifies the switching-policy dominance inequality that motivates the
//! state-action pair cache:
//!
//! ```text
//!   Σ_z min_a ε_a(z)  ≤  min_a Σ_z ε_a(z)
//!      (switching)         (single best static)
//! ```
//!
//! The left-hand side is the error of a *state-dependent switching* policy
//! (pick the best action per state); the right-hand side is the error of the
//! best *single static* action applied everywhere. The inequality holds
//! pointwise (the per-state min dominates any fixed choice) and is **strict**
//! whenever no single action dominates in every state.
//!
//! This is a pure-math test — it does NOT use the cache or the search. It
//! proves the theoretical foundation before the Phase 3 benchmark tests the
//! practical cache benefit.

/// Synthetic kernel-error landscape: `ε_a(z)` for `a ∈ {0,1,2}` and `z` over a
/// discrete grid of states. Each action has a different "region of strength":
/// - action 0 wins (lowest error) in states 0..50
/// - action 1 wins in states 50..100
/// - action 2 is never the best (a "decoy" action — present to exercise the
///   min over a 3-action set without affecting the dominance result)
