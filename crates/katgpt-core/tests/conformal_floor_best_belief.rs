//! Issue 010 T5 — "Report the Floor" comparison for Best-Belief Beta Selector
//! (Plan 336).
//!
//! The Best-Belief Beta Selector computes `BB_ε(S, F) = I⁻¹_ε(1+S, 1+F)` — the
//! ε-quantile of the Beta(1+S, 1+F) posterior — and selects the candidate with
//! the highest lower bound. T5 asks: **does the Beta prior (parametric,
//! regularized toward 0.5) beat the empirical MLE (raw rate S/(S+F), no
//! regularization) on selection quality?**
//!
//! ## Comparison angle (from Issue 010 T5)
//!
//! > "conservative candidate selection via Beta ε-quantile vs via empirical
//! > ε-quantile (the floor). Both are inverse-CDF reads; the question is
//! > whether the Beta prior (discrete, parametric) beats the empirical prior
//! > (continuous, nonparametric) on selection quality."
//!
//! This is NOT an interval-calibration comparison (CRPS/coverage/Winkler) —
//! it's a **selection-quality** comparison. The metric is **selection regret**:
//! `θ_best − θ_selected`, where `θ_best` is the highest true win-rate and
//! `θ_selected` is the true win-rate of the candidate each method picks.
//!
//! ## Why the empirical MLE is the honest floor
//!
//! The empirical ε-quantile of binary {0,1} outcomes is degenerate (it's 0 or
//! 1 depending on ε vs F/(S+F)). The non-degenerate empirical baseline is the
//! **MLE rate** `S/(S+F)` — the maximum-likelihood point estimate with no
//! confidence adjustment. This is the "pure exploitation" floor: it picks the
//! candidate that *looked* best in the data, with no regularization.
//!
//! The Best-Belief Beta lower bound adds two things the MLE lacks:
//! 1. **Beta(1,1) prior** — regularizes low-data candidates toward 0.5 (a
//!    candidate with 1/1 success has MLE=1.0 but BB_0.05 ≈ 0.025).
//! 2. **Conservatism** — the ε-quantile is a *lower* bound, penalizing
//!    candidates with high variance (few observations) more than the MLE.
//!
//! The question is whether these help (fewer high-variance false positives) or
//! hurt (over-cautious, misses genuinely good candidates).
//!
//! ## Expected result
//!
//! Best-Belief should WIN at low observation counts (where MLE over-fits noise
//! — a candidate with 2/2 successes looks perfect under MLE but mediocre under
//! Beta) and TIE at high observation counts (where both converge to the true
//! argmax). The crossover n characterizes the Beta prior's value.
//!
//! ## Run
