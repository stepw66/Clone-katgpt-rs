//! Type definitions for the `MicroRecurrentBeliefState` kernel family.
//!
//! See `katgpt-rs/.plans/276_micro_recurrent_belief_state.md` (Phase 1) and
//! `katgpt-rs/.research/242_Topological_State_Tracking_Recurrent_Belief.md`
//! for the full design rationale.
//!
//! # Summary
//!
//! A `MicroRecurrentBeliefState` is a small frozen kernel implementing one step
//! of `s_t = f(s_{t-1}, x_t)` over a fixed-size latent belief vector, applied
//! once per (entity, tick). Three recurrence families are anticipated by the
//! Mozer 2026 taxonomy:
//!
//! | Family | Update rule (one tick) | Plan slot |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `Attractor`    | `s_t = σ(W_s·s + W_x·x + b)`    | Phase 1 (this file's `attractor.rs`) |
//! | `LatentThought`| K iters of the attractor rule   | Phase 3 (T3.1, not yet implemented) |
//! | `DeltaRule`    | leaky integrator / SSM          | Phase 2 (`leaky.rs`, standalone mirror) |
//!
//! The kernel weights are a freeze/thaw artifact — see `snapshot.rs`.

/// The core per-entity belief-state kernel trait.
///
/// Each NPC / agent holds one kernel (frozen at spawn, hot-swappable via
/// `MicroRecurrentKernelSnapshot`) plus its own belief vector `s_t`. The kernel
/// advances the belief one tick at a time via [`step`](Self::step), and bridges
/// the latent belief vector to bounded raw scalars via
/// [`project_to_scalars`](Self::project_to_scalars).
///
/// # Latent vs raw boundary (AGENTS.md)
///
/// - The belief vector `s_t` is **latent**, local to the entity, and **never
///   synced**. Syncing it would destroy emergent per-entity personality
///   divergence and waste bandwidth (32 floats × 1000 NPCs × 20 Hz ≈ 2.4 MB/s
///   of pure subjective state).
/// - The projected scalars cross the sync boundary **raw** — they drive
///   game-visible behavior and need bit-identical deterministic replay.
/// - The bridge is one-way: `s_t → scalars`. Never reconstruct `s_t` from the
///   synced scalars (5 equations, 32 unknowns — underdetermined and lossy).
///
/// # Zero-allocation contract
///
/// [`step`](Self::step) and [`project_to_scalars`](Self::project_to_scalars)
/// operate on caller-owned slices and MUST NOT allocate. The kernel's own
/// weights are allocated once at construction and read-only thereafter.
///
/// # Determinism contract (G1.1)
///
/// Given the same `(s_0, x_1..x_T)` sequence, [`step`](Self::step) MUST produce
/// bit-identical `s_T` across runs (no hidden RNG, no threading-dependent
/// reduction order). This is enforced by reusing `katgpt_types::simd::simd_dot_f32`
/// (deterministic SIMD reduction) and `katgpt_types::simd::fast_sigmoid` (exact libm
/// path, no polynomial approximation).
