//! G2 arena harness for [`BoMSampler`](crate::BoMSampler)
//! (Plan 281 Phase 2, task T2.3).
//!
//! This module provides the **engine-side** arena structure: traits that
//! abstract "the environment" and "the planner" halves, plus a synthetic
//! reference environment on which K-hypothesis BoM planning provably beats
//! deterministic-belief planning. riir-ai implements the same traits over a
//! real bomber/go simulator to produce the empirical G2 gate (≥ +5pp win rate
//! or HL score on a real arena).
//!
//! # Why this split (the Plan 275 / Plan 281 engine/fuel pattern)
//!
//! katgpt-rs is a modelless primitives library — no game simulator, no
//! physics tick, no NPC spawn system. The paper's G2 claim ("does planning
//! against K diverse belief hypotheses improve arena win rate by ≥ +5pp?")
//! is an empirical property of the *combination* (BoM planning + a real
//! arena). It cannot be measured in katgpt-rs alone.
//!
//! But the **harness structure** — how to run two planners against the same
//! environment, how to score episodes, how to compare win rates, how to seed
//! RNG for reproducibility — is generic and ships here so riir-ai doesn't
//! reinvent it. riir-ai implements [`ArenaEnvironment`] over the real
//! bomber/go sim and calls the same [`run_arena_comparison`].
//!
//! # The synthetic G2 mechanics gate (what katgpt-rs proves)
//!
//! On [`SyntheticThreatArena`], BoM minimax-over-K beats deterministic
//! planning on a constructed adversarial scenario: the environment emits a
//! threat whose direction is uncertain, BoM's K hypotheses cover more of the
//! threat manifold than the single deterministic belief, and the minimax
//! scorer picks the action robust to the worst-case hypothesis. This is NOT
//! a real-game result — it proves the harness wiring is correct (BoM planner
//! produces a measurably different action distribution than deterministic,
//! and the win-rate math is sound).
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Every run is reproducible from `(seed, n_episodes, planner_config)`. The
//! arena RNG is a `fastrand::Rng` seeded per-episode from the global seed;
//! planners receive the same per-episode observation stream regardless of
//! which planner is active (the environment is forked between arms).
//!
//! # Latent vs raw boundary
//!
//! The arena itself is raw (deterministic, replayable). The K belief
//! hypotheses are latent and stay inside the planner — only the chosen
//! action crosses back to the environment. This matches AGENTS.md: never
//! sync the K-vector distribution, only the selected action's effect.
