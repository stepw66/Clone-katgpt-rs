//! Intra-trajectory reward shaping distilled from StepCodeReasoner (arXiv 2605.11922).
//!
//! Paper Eq. 11: Â_intra(i,g) = r_{i,g} × (1 + (1/(n-i)) × Σ_{j=i+1}^{n} r_{j,g})
//!
//! Our adaptation: after DDTree verification, scan the accepted path and compute
//! shaped rewards for each arm based on how many subsequent arms were also correct.
//!
//! Properties preserved from paper:
//! 1. Only correct arms get non-zero shaped reward
//! 2. Arms enabling more correct future arms get boosted
//! 3. No discount factor or value function needed
//!
//! λ = 0.3 (paper default). λ = 0.0 reverts to flat binary rewards.
//!
//! # Feature Gate
//!
//! All types behind `#[cfg(feature = "stepcode")]` which requires `bandit`.
