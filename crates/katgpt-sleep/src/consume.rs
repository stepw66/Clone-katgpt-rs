//! Wake-time consumer (Plan 334 Phase 1 T1.6).
//!
//! [`consume`] is the wake-time hot path — the `T_b(q, c') → a` operator
//! from the paper. Given a query `q` and the pre-computed artifact `c'`,
//! produce an answer via cheap dot-product + sigmoid-gated lookup, falling
//! through to the caller-provided `fresh_think` if the gate is low (the
//! query is unpredictable).
//!
//! # Why this is the hot path
//!
//! `consume()` runs on every player-NPC interaction. The sleep-time compute
//! (`anticipate()`) runs once per NPC per sleep cycle. The whole point of
//! the paper is: amortize the expensive sleep-time compute over many cheap
//! wake-time `consume()` calls.
//!
//! Per AGENTS.md hot-loop rules and Plan 334 T2.3 (G5 zero-alloc gate),
//! `consume()` MUST NOT allocate. The closure `fresh_think` is allowed to
//! allocate (it's the fallback path, which only fires on low-predictability
//! queries).
//!
//! # Sigmoid blend, not hard switch (AGENTS.md)
//!
//! The output is a smooth blend: `gate * z_precomputed + (1 − gate) * fresh`.
//! Per AGENTS.md ("use sigmoid not softmax"), we never hard-switch — the
//! smooth blend preserves the modelless property and avoids discontinuities
//! in the gate threshold.
//!
//! # Match modes (Issue 004)
//!
//! [`ConsumeMatchMode::Direction`] is the default topic-identification match
//! (`argmax_i <q, dir_i>`): forecast-independent, depends only on the static
//! direction catalog. [`ConsumeMatchMode::Precomputed`] is the answer-retrieval
//! match (`argmin_i ||slot_i.precomputed − q||²`): forecast-dependent, and
//! what makes the curiosity inversion's predictability correlation observable
//! through the live consume() path — when the sleep-time forecast was accurate,
//! the nearest precomputed slot is the player's true topic.
