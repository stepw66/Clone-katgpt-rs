//! Top-level orchestrator for Progressive MCGS search loops.
//!
//! Wires the three Phase 1 primitives — [`ProgressiveMcgs`] graph,
//! [`EntropyGatedScheduler`], [`StagnationGate`] — into a single
//! [`ProgressiveMcgsSearch::step`] call that runs one complete expansion:
//!
//! ```text
//! pick mode (UCT vs Elite) → pick branch → descend to leaf
//!                          → propose payload → expand primary edge
//!                          → evaluate reward → classify (Breakthrough?)
//!                          → backprop (E_T only) → update bests
//!                          → observe stagnation → fire triggers
//!                          → build reference set → add E_ref edges
//! ```
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Without this orchestrator, every consumer (game runtime, coding agent,
//! benchmark harness) must reimplement the same integration loop — see the
//! `examples/progressive_mcgs_basic.rs` pre-Phase-2 version for the ~100 lines
//! of boilerplate this replaces. The orchestrator encapsulates that loop while
//! leaving domain-specific decisions (payload construction, reward evaluation)
//! to a consumer-provided [`SearchDomain`] impl.
//!
//! # Domain Boundary (vs. ConstraintPruner / BanditPruner)
//!
//! This module intentionally does **not** integrate with `ConstraintPruner`
//! (token-stream validity — see `crates/katgpt-core/src/traits.rs`) or
//! `BanditPruner` (per-arm UCB1 — see `src/pruners/bandit.rs`). Those operate
//! on token streams; Progressive MCGS operates on a graph of arbitrary node
//! payloads. Forcing unification would be type-system violence — see
//! Plan 272 Phase 2 tasks T2.1–T2.3 for the full rejected-audit reasoning.
//!
//! Consumers wanting both worlds compose them at a higher layer: run
//! `ProgressiveMcgsSearch` to pick *which branch* to expand, then use
//! `ConstraintPruner` / `BanditPruner` inside the `SearchDomain::propose`
//! impl to pick *which token* to draft within that branch.
//!
//! # Allocation Discipline
//!
//! `step()` itself may allocate a `Vec<NodeId>` for the reference set (one-shot
//! per expansion, size ≤ `3·k` where k is the operator bound — typically ≤ 9).
//! The inner hot paths (`select`, `backprop`, `q_value`) remain zero-alloc as
//! guaranteed by Phase 1.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use katgpt_rs::progressive_mcgs::{
//!     search::{ProgressiveMcgsSearch, SearchDomain, StepResult},
//!     BranchId, NodeId, ProgressiveMcgsConfig, Reward, RngLite,
//! };
//!
//! // Trivial domain: payload = step counter, reward = deterministic.
//! struct CounterDomain;
