## TL;DR

This is a **textbook**, not a single-mechanism paper. **Verdict: Pass on novelty** — every chapter (flow matching, score matching, classifier-free guidance, VAEs, discrete diffusion/CTMCs, generator matching) is already covered by 12+ research notes in the corpus and is shipping in `katgpt-rs/src/dllm.rs`, ELF (Plan 079), D2F (Plan 066), DiffusionSampler (Plan 116), RecFM (150), QGF (236), and GDSD (151/186).

The artifact value here is **not a new plan**. It is a **vocabulary crosswalk** between MIT 6.S184's mathematical notation and our codebase's mechanism names. This crosswalk exists to prevent the three documented false-Super-GOAT failure modes:

- **#1 `evolve_hla` (no notes framing):** a per-NPC recurrent belief-state kernel ships in `katgpt-rs/crates/katgpt-core/src/sense/reconstruction.rs` with no `.research/` note framing it as a denoising/belief kernel. Notes-only grep misses it.
- **#2 `latent_functor/reestimation.rs` (different vocabulary):** DiPOD's "interleave self-distillation when ELBO drifts" ships as "coherence-driven re-estimation when coherence < τ_reest". Paper-vocabulary grep misses BOTH notes AND code.
- **#3 R269 (adapter-routing default):** defaulting to adapter routing when a latent-functor/HLA/LatCal reframing is available.

Future diffusion/score/flow-matching research notes should grep this crosswalk first.

**Rows marked "gap" are not yet shipped or framed.** They are candidate fusion angles (§3), **not** novel mechanisms until Q1–Q4 novelty gate passes.

## 3. Latent-space reframings (mandatory per workflow §1.5 step 3)

For each of the five Super-GOAT factory modules, what does this textbook's machinery look like?

### 3.1 HLA (`katgpt-rs/crates/katgpt-core/src/sense/` + `riir-ai/.../hla/`)

**HLA is NOT a diffusion denoiser.** Verified by reading `hla/kernel.rs`: HLA is a **second-order linear-attention streaming recurrence** with leaky decay γ (`SK += kkᵀ`, `CQV += qvᵀ`, `mQ += q`, exponential decay). It tracks second-order moments, not Bayesian posteriors. Treating HLA as `D_t(x) = E[z|x]` would be the R269 failure mode (defaulting to a plausible-sounding but wrong reframe).

The **correct** mapping: HLA is closer to a **linear-attention state-space model** (cf. 070 Gated DeltaNet, 230 Semiseparable SSD), where the recurrence plays the role of an ODE integrator. The denoiser analogy applies only to `BakeStillState::from_posterior` in LoRA continual training, not to runtime HLA.

### 3.2 `latent_functor/` (`zone_gating`, `reestimation`, `arithmetic`, `cross_game`, `k_selector`, `quality_gate`)

The textbook's **marginalization trick** (Thm 9: `u(x) = ∫ u(x|z) p_1|t(z|x) dz`) is the formal justification for treating `latent_functor/zone_gating.rs` as a posterior-weighted mixture of zone-specific vector fields. Each zone = a "conditional vector field", the gate = the posterior. This is consistent with 161 dMoE and 246 Manifold Power Iteration MoE Router framings. **Not novel — just clarifying vocabulary.**

`latent_functor/reestimation.rs`'s "coherence-driven re-estimation when coherence < τ_reest" is the codebase-vocabulary equivalent of DiPOD's "interleave self-distillation when ELBO drifts". Already documented as failure mode #2.

### 3.3 `cgsp_runtime/` (curiosity-guided self-play)

Verified by reading `cgsp_runtime/runtime.rs`: curiosity is modeled as a **decayed-absorb priority bandit** (`p ← p·decay + reward`, decay=0.7, capped at 1.0). This is **NOT** Langevin dynamics or SDE-driven exploration. The textbook's `σ_t` as a noise-injection knob for exploration is a genuinely different mechanism — see Issue 037.

### 3.4 LatCal (`riir-ai/.../encoding/latcal*.rs`)

LatCal is the **deterministic raw↔latent bridge**. Textbook VAE §6.2 and §D give the rate-distortion framework for choosing how much to compress. Currently we heuristically commit "5 scalars across sync boundary" (valence/arousal/desperation/calm/fear per AGENTS.md); this should be reframed as a Pareto-optimal rate-distortion point. The textbook's Figure 22 "knee of the frontier" is exactly the design principle.

**LatCal stays deterministic (raw) — VAE stochasticity does NOT cross the sync boundary.** The textbook's VAE machinery applies to the *local* latent representation, not the committed values.

### 3.5 Adapter routing (`adapters/`, `polytope_router.rs`, dMoE)

Classifier-free guidance `(1-w)u(∅) + w·u(y)` is mathematically identical to **freeze/thaw adapter linear interpolation**: each frozen adapter is a "guided vector field", the unconditioned baseline is `u(∅)`, and `w` is the routing weight. This is the R269 warning — adapter routing is the GOAT-tier framing, **not** the Super-GOAT framing. The latent-functor/LatCal reframing is stronger when available.

---

## 4. Verdict

**Pass on novelty.** Every chapter of this textbook ships or is covered by existing research notes. No new mechanism. No new capability class. No Super-GOAT, no GOAT, no Gain, no plan.

**Reference value:** this note exists as a **vocabulary crosswalk** (§2) for future diffusion/flow-matching/score research. The three documented false-Super-GOAT failure modes are caused by vocabulary mismatch between paper and codebase; this crosswalk is the prophylactic. **Cite this note** when future research touches: score functions, flow matching, classifier-free guidance, denoising, noise schedules, VAE rate-distortion, CTMCs, MDLM, generator matching, Fokker-Planck, or Langevin dynamics.

**One-line reasoning:** Super-GOAT requires novel mechanism + new capability class + product selling point + force multiplier. This textbook has none of those relative to our existing corpus — it is foundational material we already ship.

## 5. Future fusion candidates (issues status)

Both fusion candidates from the initial version of this note have been **closed** after running the Q1–Q4 novelty gate:

- **Issue 037 — SDE Extension σ as runtime determinism/exploration knob.** ❌ **CLOSED NOT NOVEL.** Vocabulary translation revealed `TrdConfig::elf_noise_scale` (default 0.1) + `inject_sde_noise` (ELF Plan 079) **already ship the exact mechanism**. The stronger version (gradient-guided Langevin) was tested by PTRM (Research 049 §6.1, §7.4) and gave **zero improvement** over plain Gaussian — explicit negative result. Lesson: original Issue 037 was created from a paper-vocabulary-only grep that missed `noise_scale`/`inject_sde_noise`/`elf_noise_scale`. This is exactly the workflow §1.5 step 1 #2 failure mode the crosswalk was meant to prevent.

- **Issue 038 — GLASS Flows (Remark 21) for MCTS collapse bridge.** ❌ **CLOSED NOT APPLICABLE.** Reading the actual GLASS Flows paper (arxiv 2509.25170) revealed the lecture-note Remark over-generalized. GLASS is narrowly scoped to **reward alignment in diffusion models** (SMC/search/guidance that already sample from `pt′|t` of a flow model). `mcts_collapse_bridge.rs` operates on MCTS visit statistics (δmg discriminator), not flow sampling — GLASS doesn't apply. GLASS would only become relevant if we ship a continuous-flow NPC behavior policy that needs SMC reward steering; we don't have one today.

Two smaller reframings remain mentioned in §3 but **not** worth issues (too small to track):
- "MoE router = Bayesian posterior over expert identity" (theoretical clarification of 161/246, not new mechanism)
- "Fokker-Planck as runtime invariant validator" (small implementation detail, ~20 LOC sanity check on HLA updates — pick up next time HLA integrity is touched)

## TL;DR

MIT 6.S184 is the canonical diffusion/flow-matching textbook. Every chapter ships or is covered in our corpus. **Verdict: Pass on novelty.** The artifact here is a vocabulary crosswalk (§2) to prevent future false-Super-GOAT claims caused by paper-vs-codebase vocabulary mismatch. The two initial "gap" angles (σ-as-runtime-knob, GLASS-flows-for-MCTS) were tracked as Issues 037/038, ran through the Q1–Q4 novelty gate, and **both closed**: 037 because `elf_noise_scale`/`inject_sde_noise` already ship (plus PTRM proved gradient-guided Langevin adds nothing), 038 because GLASS Flows is narrowly reward-alignment for diffusion models and doesn't apply to `mcts_collapse_bridge.rs`. The vocabulary crosswalk itself was the durable output — and the closures proved its worth (Issue 037's failure mode is exactly what the crosswalk was meant to catch, once it was extended with the missing rows).
