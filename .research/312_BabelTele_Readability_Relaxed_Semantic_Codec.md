## TL;DR

BabelTele is an **empirical probe** showing instruction-tuned LLMs can decode model-native compressed textual representations that sacrifice human readability while preserving semantics: **99.5% semantic fidelity at 27.9% of original length** (3.6× compression), zero-shot cross-model transferable across Gemini/GPT/Qwen/Kimi/Claude, black-box prompt-only (no training, no special tokens). The three principles are **Omnilingual Lexical Selection**, **Symbolic Collapse**, **Recoverable Semantic Density**.

**Distilled for katgpt-rs (modelless, inference-time):** a generic `BabelCodec { compressor, reader }` API that applies the readability-relaxed semantic projection at two layers — (a) **text-level** via fixed mapping rules (deterministic, BT-P8-style) for NPC dialog memory / player prompt / KG-triple compression, and (b) **latent-level** via sigmoid-gated projection (deterministic) as the math analog. The text-level codec is **genuinely novel for this codebase** — the latent-level adaptive-bandwidth cousin (`npc_comms` Plan 311 / Research 133) already ships via `NpcLatentMessage { hla_slice }` + `DensityBudget`, so BabelTele's *latent* framing is largely subsumed; the *text* framing is the new capability.

## 1. Paper Core Findings

### 1.1 The phenomenon — readability is decouplable from recoverability

The paper's central empirical claim (Fig 2): on QuALITY QA, **Gemini 3.1 Pro maintains 90% accuracy on BabelTele-compressed inputs while human readers drop to 35.8%**. BabelTele text has Dale-Chall 16.70 (vs 10.28 original) and 80.19% difficult-word ratio (vs 35.97%) — i.e., it is far outside the natural-language distribution (Table 1: PPL 176–301 across base models, vs 7–15 for original) yet still model-decodable.

**Implication for us:** model-readable representations need not be human-readable. This is *philosophical validation* for the codebase's existing design choices (HLA 8-dim latent is not human-readable; `NpcLatentMessage.hla_slice` is not human-readable) and unlocks a new design space for text/JSON surfaces where the consumer is another model.

### 1.2 The compression frontier — 3.6× at near-lossless

Across 116 runs on QuALITY (2128 Q) + MeetingBank (2586 Q), BabelTele traces a favorable accuracy-retention frontier vs LLMLingua-2 and abstractive summaries (Fig 3). Headline number from the abstract: **27.9% retention = 3.58× compression at 99.5% relative accuracy** on the QuALITY cross-model setting. Multi-agent communication (Table 3): 38.96% token reduction (homogeneous) / 44.21% (heterogeneous) at 96.6% / 99.7% score retention.

**Implication for us:** when the consumer is a model, 3–4× token/bandwidth savings are achievable without training. This is the same order of magnitude as MUX-Latent's latent compression (14–29× TTFT, Plan 238) but at the **text surface**, not the embedding surface.

### 1.3 Cross-model transfer — zero-shot portability

LongBench v2 + QuALITY transfer matrices (Figs 6–7): BabelTele representations compressed by one model are decoded by heterogeneous readers with 78–110% retained accuracy. Portability is **systematic but not universal** — strong compressors (GPT-5.4, Claude) produce broadly portable forms; Qwen/Kimi forms are more pair-dependent. Scale alone does not explain it (Table 2: Qwen3.5-397B-A17B underperforms Qwen3.5-27B on Gemini-induced BabelTele).

**Implication for us:** validates that heterogeneous NPCs (different reader LoRAs / different base LLMs per NPC class) can decode each other's compressed representations without pairwise training. The "compressor-reader pair" abstraction is real.

### 1.4 Three principles (the prompt family)

Section 3.2 + Appendix C.2 (13 prompt variants BT-P1…BT-P13):

| Principle | What it does | Codebase analog |
|---|---|---|
| **Omnilingual Lexical Selection** | Pick highest info-density lexical unit across all languages/scripts | Cross-axis latent projection (HLA → multiple semantic axes) |
| **Symbolic Collapse** | Replace conjunctions/sentences with emoji, math/logic operators, punctuation | Sigmoid-gated sparsification (fire only top-k projections) |
| **Recoverable Semantic Density** | Preserve recoverable semantic details; no external codebook | Invertibility constraint on the codec (reader must recover) |

**Critical for our use:** BT-P8 (Fixed Symbolic Mapping Rules) and BT-P13 (ASCII Anchor Skeleton) are **deterministic** mapping schemas (`S[topic]`, `*(entity):K=V`, `Config[target]:K=V(unit)`, `A->B->C`, `?cond=>action`, `!obj:detail`, `A<>B:conclusion`). These are NOT LLM-generated — they are fixed rewrite rules. **This is the modelless subset of BabelTele.**

### 1.5 Cognitive overhead tradeoff (the honest caveat)

Fig 4: stronger compression → longer reader CoT chains (1× → 5× at extreme retention). BabelTele does not introduce unique overhead vs LLMLingua-2/summary, but the space-time tradeoff is real: input savings are partially offset by reasoning-token growth. **Optimal compression is moderate, not maximal.**

## 2. Distillation

### 2.1 What's modelless (ships in katgpt-rs)

The paper's LLM-prompted BabelTele is **not** modelless from a weights perspective — it requires a forward pass through an instruction-tuned LLM. But the paper itself ships a modelless subset: **BT-P8 / BT-P13 fixed mapping rules** are deterministic token-rewrite functions. Distill those.

The distilled primitive is a `BabelCodec` trait:

```rust
pub trait BabelCodec {
    type Input;
    type Compressed;
    type Reader;

    /// Readability-relaxed semantic projection. Deterministic.
    fn compress(&self, input: &Self::Input) -> Self::Compressed;
    /// Recover semantics. Deterministic inverse (where defined).
    fn decompress(reader: &Self::Reader, c: &Self::Compressed) -> Self::Input;
    /// Compression ratio achieved on the last call (for budgeting).
    fn last_ratio(&self) -> f32;
}
```

Two concrete implementations ship in katgpt-rs:

1. **`FixedRuleTextCodec`** — BT-P8 / BT-P13 fixed mapping rules. Input: `&str` (or token slice). Output: `&[u8]` compressed bytes. Deterministic, replayable, BLAKE3-commitable. This is the modelless subset.
2. **`SigmoidLatentCodec<D>`** — deterministic dot-product projection + sigmoid gate on a `&[f32; D]` latent vector. Output: top-k projected scalars. This is the math analog and is **structurally identical to what `npc_comms` already does** with `DensityBudget` + `extract_hla_slice` (Plan 311) — so the latent flavor largely re-packages existing infrastructure under a generic trait.

### 2.2 What's training-only (NOT here, → riir-train)

- The LLM-prompted BabelTele compression (the headline 3.6× number) requires an instruction-tuned LLM in the loop. The prompt-elicited compression is **not a deterministic function**. If we want a *learned* BabelCodec that beats the fixed-rule baseline, that's adapter training → riir-train.
- The §3.5 modelless-unblock check: the *fixed-rule* subset (BT-P8/P13) IS the modelless unblock for "BabelTele-style compression without an LLM". The three paths (freeze/thaw, raw/lora hot-swap, latent correction) are not needed because the deterministic mapping rules already exist in the paper.

### 2.3 Fusion — BabelTele × existing pillars

The highest-value combination is **NOT** a single-paper direct map. It is the fusion of BabelTele's text-level readability relaxation with three existing pillars:

| Pillar | Existing shipped primitive | BabelTele fusion | New capability |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Engram memory** (Plan 299) | Hash-addressed pattern memory, `tokenizer.rs` already does pattern compression | `FixedRuleTextCodec` as Engram's text-side compressor for natural-language episodic memories (quest dialog, NPC backstories) | NPCs store 3–4× more dialog history per Engram slot |
| **MUX-Latent** (Plan 238, default-on) | Latent superposition context compression (14–29× TTFT) | `BabelCodec` as the *text-side* companion to MUX's *latent-side* compression — text in, latent out, both shrink | Two-layer compression: BabelTele text → MUX latent → forward pass |
| **npc_comms** (Plan 311, Research 133) | Latent-level adaptive-bandwidth NPC mind-reading via `NpcLatentMessage { hla_slice }` + `DensityBudget` | Add a **text channel** alongside the latent channel: `NpcTextMessage { babel_compressed: Vec<u8> }` for NPC dialog that must remain textual (player-facing logs, quest text) | NPC dialog bandwidth drops 3–4× without losing semantics for model consumers |
| **LoraPair {reader, writer}** (Plan 025) | Reader active during prefill, writer during decode | `BabelPair { compressor, reader }` is the structural analog for text — one NPC's "dialect" compresses, the recipient's reader decompresses | Per-NPC dialect encoding without per-pair training (cross-model transfer validates this) |
| **LatCal** (riir-chain) | Deterministic 2×2 matrix fixed-point commitment | **`FixedRuleTextCodec` output is deterministic → LatCal-commitable**. BabelTele-compressed KG triples cross the sync boundary at 3–4× lower byte cost. | Cheaper chain commitment of semantic triples (see §2.4 — fusion TBD, needs gate) |

### 2.4 Fusion TBD — Super-GOAT-conditional path (NOT committed)

A stronger fusion exists **if and only if** the deterministic BT-P8 mapping survives a fidelity gate against uncompressed KG triples. The path:

1. KG triple emission (per AGENTS.md "semantic encounters → KG triple from latent similarity") currently uses verbose triple format `(subject, predicate, object)` with natural-language labels.
2. `FixedRuleTextCodec` compresses to BT-P8 form: `*(subj):pred=obj` → ~3–4× shorter, deterministic, BLAKE3-commitable.
3. LatCal-commit the compressed form → crosses the sync boundary at lower byte cost.
4. Cold-tier replay reconstructs the original triple via the deterministic inverse (BT-P8 inverse is well-defined for the `*(e):k=v` schema).

**Why this is fusion-TBD and not Super-GOAT-now:** the Q2 novelty question ("new class of behavior?") is uncertain. The latent-level bandwidth adaptation is already shipped (npc_comms). Text-level KG-triple compression is incremental on top of an existing capability class, not a new class. The deterministic-chain-commitment angle is novel but depends on:
- (a) BT-P8 fidelity on real KG triples (untested — needs G1 gate).
- (b) LatCal commitment cost not exceeding the byte savings (needs CG2-style gate).
- (c) Replay determinism across architectures (needs CG1-style gate).

Per the skill rule ("do not write 'Super-GOAT candidate'"), this fusion is tracked in `.issues/002_deterministic_babeltele_chain_commitment.md` (Issue 002 was closed + removed; closed as moot after Plan 331 G2 FAILED) — not committed here.

---

## 3. Verdict

**GOAT.** Provable gain (3–4× text compression at near-lossless fidelity, validated by the paper's 116-run frontier) over the existing uncompressed text path for NPC dialog memory / player prompts / KG-triple surfaces. Promotes to default if the GOAT gate passes on a real Seal corpus (the same one that killed CompressionDrafter — Plan 285/287).

**One-line reasoning:** the latent-level adaptive-bandwidth cousin (`npc_comms` Plan 311) already ships the higher-value half of BabelTele's selling point; the text-level codec is a real, narrower win that complements (not creates) the existing capability class.

### Why NOT Super-GOAT

- **Q1 (no prior art):** paper-vocabulary grep ZERO hits — but codebase-vocabulary grep shows `npc_comms` ships the latent-level analog, `LoraPair` ships the compressor-reader pair analog, `Engram` ships the hash-pattern memory analog. Text-level BabelCodec is novel; the *capability class* (model-native compressed representations) is partially shipped.
- **Q2 (new class of behavior):** **NO** — extends existing latent comms / memory / pair patterns to the text surface. Incremental class, not new class.
- **Q3 (selling point):** "NPCs store 3.6× more dialog history" — real but narrower than the original "thousands of NPCs communicate via model-native representations" framing (which is already true at the latent level).
- **Q4 (force multiplier):** YES — touches Engram, MUX-Latent, npc_comms, LoraPair, (conditional) LatCal. But Q2 fails, so Super-GOAT fails.

### Why not Gain

- Provable 3–4× compression at near-lossless fidelity is headline-worthy on the text surface (where we have no compressor — CompressionDrafter failed twice).
- Cross-model transfer validates the compressor-reader pair abstraction for heterogeneous NPC populations.
- The fixed-rule (BT-P8/P13) subset is genuinely modelless and deterministic — no LLM in the loop, no training.

## 4. Honest caveats

1. **The paper's headline 3.6× number is LLM-prompted, not deterministic.** Our modelless subset (BT-P8/P13 fixed rules) will achieve *lower* compression than the prompt-elicited version because it cannot do omnilingual lexical selection. Honest expectation: 2–3× on KG triples, 1.5–2× on natural-language dialog. The GOAT gate must measure the *deterministic* number, not the paper's prompt-elicited number.
2. **Cognitive overhead tradeoff (paper Fig 4) applies.** A reader LLM consuming BabelTele-compressed text may emit longer CoT chains. For NPCs without an LLM in the loop (pure latent path), this is moot. For player-facing dialog, this is moot (we decompress to natural language before showing the player). For NPC-to-NPC text comms where both have LLMs, the tradeoff is real and must be budgeted.
3. **CompressionDrafter (Plan 285/287) failed GOAT on the real Seal corpus.** BabelTele's fixed-rule codec must be benchmarked on the *same* Seal corpus to avoid repeating that failure mode. The honest expectation is that BabelTele wins where CompressionDrafter lost, because (a) BabelTele operates on semantic structure not byte-level LZ4 matches, and (b) the fixed-rule schema is purpose-built for KG-triple / entity-attribute / config surfaces, which is what quest grammar + dialog actually are.
4. **Cross-model transfer does not transfer automatically to our NPCs.** The paper tests Gemini/GPT/Qwen/Kimi/Claude — all frontier instruction-tuned LLMs. Our NPC population may use smaller / specialized models. The portability claim must be re-validated on our actual NPC model zoo before relying on it for cross-NPC dialect decoding.
5. **The latent-level `SigmoidLatentCodec<D>` implementation is largely a re-skin of `DensityBudget` + `extract_hla_slice` (Plan 311).** Do not double-count this as novelty — it is the generic trait facade over existing infrastructure. Its value is API uniformity (same `BabelCodec` trait for text and latent), not new capability.

---

## TL;DR

BabelTele empirically validates that LLMs decode model-native compressed text (3.6× at 99.5% fidelity, zero-shot cross-model). For our codebase, the **latent-level** analog already ships (`npc_comms` Plan 311 via `NpcLatentMessage { hla_slice }` + `DensityBudget`) — so BabelTele's novelty is the **text-level** codec: a deterministic `FixedRuleTextCodec` (BT-P8/P13 fixed mapping rules) for NPC dialog memory, player prompts, and KG-triple surfaces, plus a generic `BabelCodec` trait that unifies text and latent compression under one API. **Verdict: GOAT** (not Super-GOAT — the capability class is partially shipped at the latent level). Fusion with Engram (compressed episodic memory), MUX-Latent (text→latent two-layer compression), npc_comms (text channel alongside latent), and LoraPair (compressor-reader pair analog) is the value path. A Super-GOAT-conditional fusion (deterministic BT-P8 → LatCal chain commitment of KG triples) is tracked in `.issues/002_deterministic_babeltele_chain_commitment.md` (Issue 002 was closed + removed; closed as moot after Plan 331 G2 FAILED) — not committed here because Q2 (new class of behavior) is uncertain.
