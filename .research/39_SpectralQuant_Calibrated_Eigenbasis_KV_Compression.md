# Research: SpectralQuant — Calibrated Eigenbasis Rotation and Water-Filled Bit Allocation for KV-Cache Compression (39)

> Source: [3% Is All You Need: Breaking TurboQuant's Compression Limit via Spectral Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19874) by Anirudh B. Vangara, Ashwin Gopinath (Sentra / MIT), NeurIPS 2026 submission
> Local: `.raw/spectralquant/` (upstream Python, full repo with experiments + paper)
> Date: 2026-04 (paper), distilled 2025-07
> **Verdict: HIGH VALUE — Direct upgrade path from our existing TurboQuant implementation. Spectral rotation + water-fill + selective QJL are composable improvements with strong empirical backing.**

## TL;DR

SpectralQuant exploits a universal structural property of LLM KV caches: key covariance matrices have effective dimension (`d_eff`) of only **3–5% of the head dimension**. Across Qwen2.5 (1.5B, 7B, 14B), Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B, and Gemma-2, the participation ratio `d_eff/d_h` is consistently ~3–5% (d_eff ∈ [4, 6] at d_h = 128). This means ~124 of 128 coordinates are noise after proper rotation.

The method replaces TurboQuant's random rotation with **calibrated eigenvector rotation** (data-dependent, one-time calibration), adds **water-filled bit allocation** inside the semantic subspace (greedy argmax λ_i/4^b_i), applies **selective QJL** only on the d_eff-wide semantic subspace (not the full d dimensions), and uses **per-dimension Lloyd-Max codebooks** fitted on actual coordinate distributions.

Result: **+0.27 to +0.38 cosine improvement** over TurboQuant across all tested operating points, **+0.018 from water-fill alone** at b=2 on Mistral, **5.95× compression** at b≈3 on Qwen2.5-14B, and **2.2× faster** than TurboQuant due to skipped QJL on tail dimensions.

## 1. Paper Summary

### The Core Insight

TurboQuant's random rotation treats all coordinates as identically distributed (Beta marginal). This is optimal for *worst-case* isotropic vectors but suboptimal for *real* LLM key vectors, which have highly anisotropic covariance. SpectralQuant measures that anisotropy via eigendecomposition and exploits it at three levels:

1. **Subspace level**: Replace random Π with calibrated V^T (eigenvectors of per-layer, per-head key covariance). After rotation, the first d_eff coordinates carry ~95% of variance; the remaining (d - d_eff) carry noise.

2. **Allocation level**: Inside the semantic subspace, allocate bits proportional to eigenvalue magnitude via water-filling: `i* = argmax λ_i / 4^b_i` (greedy, one bit at a time).

3. **Correction level**: Apply QJL residual estimation only to the d_eff semantic coordinates, not all d. This saves (d - d_eff) bits per token and avoids wasting sketch budget on noise.

### The Empirical Law

The participation ratio `d_eff = (Σλ_i)² / Σλ_i²` is remarkably stable across architectures:

| Model | d_h | d_eff (keys) | d_eff/d_h | d_eff (values) | Ratio K/V |
|-------|-----|-------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Qwen2.5-1.5B | 128 | ~4 | ~3.1% | ~40 | 10× |
| Qwen2.5-7B | 128 | ~4 | ~3.1% | ~45 | 11× |
| Qwen2.5-14B | 128 | ~5 | ~3.9% | ~50 | 10× |
| Mistral-7B | 128 | ~5 | ~3.9% | ~45 | 9× |
| Llama-3-8B | 128 | ~4 | ~3.1% | ~40 | 10× |
| Gemma-2-9B | 256 | ~6 | ~2.3% | ~55 | 9× |

This is not a distribution shift artifact — it holds across layers, heads, sequence positions, and random seeds. The KV asymmetry (keys d_eff ≈ 4, values d_eff ≈ 40–55) explains why low-rank compression catastrophically fails for values while succeeding for keys.

### The Three Regimes After Spectral Rotation

After rotating into the eigenbasis V^T, the d coordinates split into:

1. **Semantic regime** (coordinates 0..d_eff-1): High eigenvalue, concentrated signal. Gets b_high bits per coordinate + QJL correction. Per-dimension Lloyd-Max codebooks fitted on actual rotated data.

2. **Tail regime** (coordinates d_eff..d-1): Near-zero eigenvalue, effectively noise. Gets b_low bits per coordinate (often 0 or 1), no QJL correction. Cheap uniform quantization suffices.

3. **Bit allocation within semantic**: Water-fill distributes the semantic bit budget (`d_eff × b_high` total bits) across d_eff dimensions proportionally to eigenvalue magnitude. Dominant dimensions get more bits; minor semantic dimensions get fewer.

## 2. Key Algorithms

### 2.1 Participation Ratio (Effective Dimension)

```text
d_eff = (Σᵢ λᵢ)² / Σᵢ λᵢ²
```

Where λᵢ are the eigenvalues of the per-(layer, head) key covariance matrix, sorted descending.

This is the standard participation ratio from condensed matter physics. For an isotropic covariance (all λ equal), d_eff = d. For a rank-1 covariance (one dominant λ), d_eff ≈ 1. For real LLM keys, d_eff ≈ 4–6 at d = 128.

From the source (`calibration.py`):

```python
def _participation_ratio(eigenvalues):
    lam = eigenvalues.double()
    sum_lam = lam.sum()
    sum_lam_sq = (lam ** 2).sum()
    if sum_lam_sq < 1e-12:
        return 1.0
    return float((sum_lam ** 2) / sum_lam_sq)
```

**Spectral gap** at the boundary: κ = λ_{d_eff} / λ_{d_eff+1}. When κ >> 1, the semantic/tail split is clean. When κ ≈ 1, the split is less sharp.

**Variance thresholds**: The minimum k for 95% and 99% cumulative variance. For d_eff ≈ 4, typically 95% is reached at k ≤ d_eff and 99% at k ≈ 2 × d_eff.

### 2.2 Calibrated Eigenbasis Rotation

**TurboQuant (our current approach)**:
```
Π = QR(random_gaussian(d, d))    # Haar-random orthogonal
ŷ = Π^T · x                       # rotate
x̂ = Π · ŷ                         # unrotate
```

**SpectralQuant**:
```
C = (1/N) Σₙ kₙ kₙ^T             # per-(layer,head) key covariance
λ, V = eigendecompose(C)          # V columns = eigenvectors, descending λ
ŷ = V^T · x                       # rotate into eigenbasis
x̂ = V · ŷ                         # unrotate back
```

Key properties:
- V is orthogonal (V^T V = I), so inner products are exactly preserved
- The first d_eff rows of V^T · x capture the signal subspace
- V is data-dependent but computed once during calibration (offline)
- Calibration takes ~15 seconds on a B200 for a 14B model

From the source (`spectral_rotation.py`):

```python
class SpectralRotation(BaseRotation):
    def rotate(self, x, layer_idx, head_idx):
        _, Vt = self._get_matrices(layer_idx, head_idx)  # cached (V, V^T)
        return x @ Vt.T   # x @ V == (V^T x^T)^T

    def unrotate(self, x, layer_idx, head_idx):
        V, _ = self._get_matrices(layer_idx, head_idx)
        return x @ V.T    # x @ V^T
```

### 2.3 Water-Filled Bit Allocation

Given eigenvalues λ_0 ≥ λ_1 ≥ ... ≥ λ_{d_eff-1} and a total bit budget B = d_eff × b_high:

```text
Initialize: b_i = 0 for all i in [0, d_eff)
For each of B iterations:
    i* = argmax_i  λ_i / 4^b_i     # marginal MSE reduction
    b_{i*} += 1
```

The formula λ_i / 4^b_i comes from the MSE distortion: each additional bit reduces MSE by a factor of 4 for that dimension. The greedy argmax allocates the next bit to the dimension where it reduces the most weighted distortion.

Tie-breaking: lowest index wins (deterministic).

From the source (`waterfill.py`):

```python
def allocate_waterfill_bits(eigenvalues, total_bits, min_bits=0, max_bits=None):
    eig_safe = np.maximum(eigenvalues, eps)
    bits = np.full(d, int(min_bits), dtype=np.int64)
    remaining = total_bits - d * min_bits
    for _ in range(remaining):
        scores = eig_safe / np.power(4.0, bits.astype(np.float64))
        if max_bits is not None:
            scores = np.where(bits >= max_bits, -np.inf, scores)
        i = int(np.argmax(scores))  # lowest index on tie
        bits[i] += 1
    return bits
```

**Example** with λ = [0.80, 0.12, 0.05, 0.02] and B = 12 (avg 3 bits/dim):

| Step | b_0 | b_1 | b_2 | b_3 | Winner |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | λ_0/1=0.80 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | λ_0/4=0.20 |
| 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | λ_0/16=0.05 vs λ_1/1=0.12 → dim 1 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Final | 5 | 3 | 2 | 2 | Sum=12 ✓ |

The dominant dimension gets 5 bits while minor dimensions get 2 — a significant departure from uniform 3-bit allocation.

### 2.4 Selective QJL

**TurboQuant**: Apply QJL sign sketch to all d coordinates.
```
ŝ = (d/m) · ⟨q, S·k⟩     where S ∈ {±1}^{m × d}
```

**SpectralQuant**: Apply QJL only to d_eff semantic coordinates.
```
ŝ = (d_eff/m) · ⟨q_{:d_eff}, S·k_{:d_eff}⟩    where S ∈ {±1}^{m × d_eff}
```

Bits saved per token: `(d - d_eff)` — for d=128, d_eff=4, this saves 124 bits per key vector per token.

The estimate is unbiased for the partial inner product over the semantic subspace. Adding the exact (trivially computed) inner product over the dequantized tail gives an unbiased estimate of the full inner product.

From the source (`selective_qjl.py`):

```python
class SelectiveQJL(BaseQJL):
    def compute_correction(self, keys, queries, d_eff):
        k_sem = keys[:, :, :d_eff].float()
        q_sem = queries[:, :, :d_eff].float()
        S = self._rademacher_signs(d_eff, self.n_projections, device)
        sk = k_sem @ S.T
        sq = q_sem @ S.T
        scale = d_eff / self.n_projections
        return scale * torch.bmm(sq, sk.transpose(1, 2))
```

### 2.5 Two-Regime Non-Uniform Quantization

After spectral rotation, the vector is split:

```text
ŷ = V^T · x
ŷ_semantic = ŷ[:d_eff]    → per-dim Lloyd-Max, water-filled bits
ŷ_tail     = ŷ[d_eff:]    → uniform low-bit Lloyd-Max (shared codebook)
```

Each semantic dimension i gets its own Lloyd-Max codebook fitted on the actual distribution of the i-th coordinate across calibration tokens. This is critical because after eigenbasis rotation, coordinate distributions are no longer identical — the first coordinate follows a narrow, high-variance distribution while d_eff-th coordinate is much flatter.

From the source (`nonuniform_quantization.py`):

```python
class NonUniformQuantizer:
    def fit(self, rotated_data, d_eff=None):
        # Tail: shared codebook over all tail coords, b_low bits
        tail_data = rotated_data[:, d_eff_int:].flatten()
        self._tail_quantizer = LloydMaxQuantizer(n_bits=b_low).fit(tail_data)

        # Semantic: per-dim codebooks, water-filled bits
        for i, b_i in enumerate(bits_per_dim):
            col_data = rotated_data[:, i].float().flatten()
            q = LloydMaxQuantizer(n_bits=b_i).fit(col_data)
            per_dim_quants.append(q)
```

### 2.6 Full Pipeline

```text
OFFLINE CALIBRATION (once per model):
  1. Register forward hooks on all attention layers
  2. Run N calibration tokens through model
  3. Collect K vectors per (layer, head)
  4. Compute covariance C = (1/N) Σ kₙ kₙ^T
  5. Eigendecompose: λ, V = eigh(C)
  6. Compute d_eff = participation_ratio(λ)
  7. Store: {eigenvalues, eigenvectors, d_eff} per (layer, head)

ONLINE COMPRESSION (per token during inference):
  1. Rotate: ŷ = V^T · k           (d multiplies → d)
  2. Split: ŷ_sem = ŷ[:d_eff], ŷ_tail = ŷ[d_eff:]
  3. Water-fill: allocate bits {b_0, ..., b_{d_eff-1}}
  4. Quantize semantic: per-dim Lloyd-Max with {b_i} bits
  5. Quantize tail: shared Lloyd-Max with b_low bits
  6. Selective QJL: sketch ŷ_sem only → 1-bit sign residual
  7. Store: packed indices + norms + QJL signs

ONLINE DECOMPRESSION:
  1. Dequantize semantic: per-dim centroid lookup
  2. Dequantize tail: shared codebook lookup
  3. Concatenate: ŷ̂ = [ŷ̂_sem, ŷ̂_tail]
  4. Unrotate: k̂ = V · ŷ̂
  5. Rescale by stored norm
```

## 3. Empirical Findings

### 3.1 Main Results — Cosine Similarity

| Model | Method | Bits | Cosine Sim | Δ vs TQ |
|-------|--------|------|------------|---------|

### 3.2 Water-Fill Contribution (Ablation)

| Model | Bits | Uniform CosSim | Water-Fill CosSim | Δ |
|-------|------|---------------|-------------------|---|
| Mistral-7B | 2 | 0.8100 | 0.8280 | +0.018 |
| Qwen2.5-7B | 2 | 0.8340 | 0.8450 | +0.011 |
| Qwen2.5-14B | 3 | 0.9400 | 0.9485 | +0.009 |

Water-fill matters most at aggressive bit budgets (b=2) and on models with heavier GQA (Mistral 4:1 GQA). At b=4, the improvement is negligible because all dimensions already have sufficient bits.

### 3.3 Perplexity

| Model | Context | Method | Perplexity |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|
| Qwen2.5-7B | 1024 tok | FP16 | 6.49 |
| Qwen2.5-7B | 1024 tok | TQ 2048 | 7.51 |
| Qwen2.5-7B | 1024 tok | SQ b≈3 | 6.98 |
| Qwen2.5-1.5B | 1024 tok | FP16 | 9.12 |
| Qwen2.5-1.5B | 1024 tok | SQ b≈3 | 9.51 |

### 3.4 Compression Ratio

| Model | Method | Effective Bits | Compression |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Qwen2.5-14B | TurboQuant | ~3.2 | 5.02× |
| Qwen2.5-14B | SpectralQuant | ~3.0 | 5.95× |
| Qwen2.5-7B | SpectralQuant | ~3.0 | 5.33× |

The compression improvement comes from: (a) b_low = 0 or 1 for tail dimensions vs b = 3 for TQ, (b) selective QJL on d_eff ≪ d instead of full QJL.

### 3.5 Latency

| Sequence Length | TurboQuant | SpectralQuant | Speedup |
|----------------|------------|---------------|---------|
| 512 tokens | 0.566 ms/step | 0.257 ms/step | 2.2× |
| 1024 tokens | 0.890 ms/step | 0.412 ms/step | 2.2× |
| 2048 tokens | 1.544 ms/step | 0.721 ms/step | 2.1× |

Faster because: (a) no QJL computation on tail coordinates, (b) fewer bits to pack/unpack on tail, (c) per-dim codebook lookups are cache-friendly for d_eff ≈ 4.

### 3.6 KV Asymmetry

| Component | d_eff (Qwen2.5-7B) | d_eff/d_h | Behavior |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|----------|
| Keys | ~4 | ~3.1% | Highly compressible |
| Values | ~45 | ~35% | NOT compressible via low-rank |

This has a critical implication: **value compression must remain near-full-rank**. Attempting d_eff ≈ 4 truncation on values destroys reconstruction (cos_sim ≈ 0.15 at r=4). SpectralQuant applies the full eigenbasis rotation + water-fill to values but with much less aggressive tail truncation.

### 3.7 Statistical Significance

10-seed test on Qwen2.5-1.5B (seeds: 42, 123, 7, 2024, 31415, 99, 1337, 8675309, 271828, 314159):

| Metric | SQ Mean | TQ Mean | 95% CI | Wilcoxon p |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|------------|
| CosSim | 0.8635 | 0.8409 | ±0.0024 (SQ) ±0.0046 (TQ) | 0.031 |

### 3.8 Calibration Stability

Coefficient of variation of d_eff across 10 seeds: **CV = 3.9%**. The spectral structure is stable — calibration on a few hundred tokens generalizes.

### 3.9 Token-Level F1

| Method | Token-F1 |
|--------|----------|
| FP16 | 1.000 |
| TurboQuant | 0.120 |
| SpectralQuant | 0.482 |

The 4× improvement in Token-F1 over TQ suggests SpectralQuant preserves token identity much better, which matters for downstream task performance.

## 4. Distillation Potential

### Model-Based vs Modelless Analysis

SpectralQuant sits at an interesting point on the model-based/modelless spectrum:

| Aspect | TurboQuant | SpectralQuant |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| Rotation | **Modelless** (random) | **Model-based** (calibrated from data) |
| Codebook | **Modelless** (Beta distribution assumption) | **Model-based** (fitted on rotated data) |
| Bit allocation | **Modelless** (uniform) | **Model-based** (water-fill from eigenvalues) |
| QJL | **Modelless** (full-dimensional) | **Model-based** (selective on semantic subspace) |
| Calibration cost | Zero | ~15 seconds (one-time) |
| Online cost per token | Higher (full QJL) | Lower (selective QJL) |

**The tradeoff is clear**: SpectralQuant pays a one-time calibration cost to get a model-specific rotation + allocation + codebooks, then reaps ongoing quality and speed benefits during inference. This is exactly the model-based/modelless duality from Research 37 (REAP).

### When to Use Which

| Scenario | Recommended |
|----------|-------------|
| Single model, long-serving, many requests | **SpectralQuant** (amortize calibration) |
| Many models, short-lived, one-shot | **TurboQuant** (zero calibration) |
| Draft model (small, fast) | **TurboQuant** (our d=4 head_dim makes d_eff meaningless) |
| Production model (7B+) | **SpectralQuant** (d_eff ≈ 4 at d=128 is huge gain) |
| Streaming / online-only | **TurboQuant** (no offline phase) |

For microgpt-rs specifically: our draft model has head_dim=4, making SpectralQuant's d_eff analysis irrelevant (d_eff would be ≈ d). But for any production model we serve with head_dim=64+, SpectralQuant is the right choice.

### What Can Be Distilled

1. **The d_eff observation** is universally true and can inform our architecture even without full SpectralQuant adoption. If we know d_eff ≈ 4 for keys, we can allocate less memory for key cache by default.

2. **Water-fill bit allocation** is a standalone improvement applicable to any non-uniform quantization scenario. The greedy argmax λ_i/4^b_i is a general principle.

3. **Selective QJL** is a standalone improvement. If we already have a rotation (even random), we can profile which coordinates carry signal and apply QJL only there.

4. **Per-dimension codebooks** are the natural next step after non-uniform bit allocation. If different dimensions get different bits, they should also get different centroids.

## 5. Relationship to Existing Work

### 5.1 vs Our TurboQuant Implementation

| Component | Our `src/turboquant/` | SpectralQuant | Gap |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------|-----|
| **Rotation** | `rotation.rs`: QR(random Gaussian) → Haar-random Π | Eigenvectors V^T from per-(layer,head) covariance | Need calibration + eigendecomposition |
| **Codebook** | `codebook.rs`: Beta distribution → single shared Lloyd-Max per (dim, bits) | Per-dimension Lloyd-Max fitted on actual rotated data | Need per-dim codebook storage + fit |
| **Bit allocation** | Uniform: same bits for all coordinates | Water-fill: greedy argmax λ_i/4^b_i | Need eigenvalue-aware allocator |
| **QJL** | `rotation.rs`: full d×d Gaussian projection matrix | Selective: only d_eff×m sign matrix | Need subspace masking |
| **KV storage** | `kv_cache.rs`: layers × positions × packed indices (uniform bits) | Two-regime: semantic (variable bits) + tail (low bits) | Need variable-bit packing |
| **Layer state** | `types.rs`: rotation + qjl_matrix + key_codebook + val_codebook | + eigenvalues + eigenvectors + d_eff + per-dim codebooks | Need richer calibration data |
| **Forward pass** | `forward.rs`: dequantize all → dot product | Selective: dequantize + QJL correction on semantic only | Need split-regime attention kernel |

### 5.2 Concrete Code Mapping

Our `TurboQuantLayer` currently holds:

```rust
pub struct TurboQuantLayer {
    pub rotation: Vec<f32>,           // d×d random orthogonal
    pub qjl_matrix: Vec<f32>,         // d×d Gaussian projection
    pub key_codebook: TurboQuantCodebook,  // single shared codebook
    pub val_codebook: TurboQuantCodebook,  // single shared codebook
}
```

SpectralQuant would extend this to:

```rust
pub struct SpectralQuantLayer {
    // Rotation: calibrated eigenvectors instead of random
    pub eigenvalues: Vec<f32>,        // d eigenvalues (descending)
    pub eigenvectors: Vec<f32>,       // d×d V matrix (row-major)
    pub d_eff: usize,                 // participation ratio

    // QJL: selective on d_eff instead of full d
    pub qjl_signs: Vec<f32>,          // m × d_eff (not d×d)

    // Quantization: per-dim instead of shared
    pub key_semantic_codebooks: Vec<TurboQuantCodebook>,  // d_eff codebooks
    pub key_semantic_bits: Vec<u8>,   // water-filled bits per dim
    pub key_tail_codebook: TurboQuantCodebook,            // shared, b_low bits
    pub key_tail_bits: u8,            // uniform low bits

    // Same structure for values (higher d_eff, less aggressive)
    pub val_eigenvalues: Vec<f32>,
    pub val_eigenvectors: Vec<f32>,
    pub val_d_eff: usize,
    pub val_semantic_codebooks: Vec<TurboQuantCodebook>,
    pub val_semantic_bits: Vec<u8>,
    pub val_tail_codebook: TurboQuantCodebook,
    pub val_tail_bits: u8,
}
```

### 5.3 What Reuses Directly

- `codebook.rs`: `TurboQuantCodebook` struct + `compute_centroids`/`compute_boundaries` logic. But the Beta distribution assumption goes away — we fit on actual data instead.
- `kv_cache.rs`: Pack/unpack infrastructure. But need to extend for variable-bit packing (water-fill produces non-uniform bits per dimension).
- `forward.rs`: The attention scoring structure. But the dequantize→score path changes to two-regime.
- `rotation.rs`: The `generate_qjl_matrix` function concept. But switch from Gaussian to Rademacher (±1) signs for efficiency.

### 5.4 What's Fundamentally New

1. **Calibration pipeline** — offline forward hook + covariance + eigendecompose. Entirely new subsystem.
2. **Eigendecomposition** — need `nalgebra` or similar for symmetric eigendecomposition. Not in our current deps.
3. **Water-fill allocator** — ~50 lines of greedy allocation. Self-contained.
4. **Per-dimension codebook fitting** — collect coordinate samples, run Lloyd-Max per dimension. Extends existing codebook logic.
5. **Variable-bit packing** — `pack_indices`/`unpack_indices` currently assume uniform bits per layer. Need per-dimension bit widths.
6. **Selective QJL attention kernel** — forward pass changes significantly.

---

## 6. What We'd Need to Implement

### Priority 1: Calibration Infrastructure (New Subsystem)

The biggest architectural gap. We need:

1. **Forward hook registration**: Run calibration tokens through model, intercept K/V at each attention layer. In Rust, this means running the forward pass and collecting the key projections before they enter the cache.

2. **Covariance computation**: For each (layer, head), accumulate `Σ kₙ kₙ^T` over N calibration tokens. For d=128, this is a 128×128 symmetric matrix per head. Memory: ~(32 layers × 32 heads × 128² × 4 bytes) ≈ 67 MB. Feasible.

3. **Eigendecomposition**: Symmetric matrix → eigenvalues + eigenvectors. `nalgebra` provides this. Alternatively, use a specialized symmetric eigensolver (Jacobi, QR algorithm). For d=128, this is fast (<1ms per head).

4. **Participation ratio**: `(Σλ)² / Σλ²` — trivial once eigenvalues are computed.

5. **Serialization**: Save/load calibration data (eigenvalues, eigenvectors, d_eff, spectral gap) per (layer, head). JSON or binary.

Estimated size: ~500 lines in new `src/turboquant/calibration.rs`.

### Priority 2: Spectral Rotation (Extends `rotation.rs`)

Replace or augment `generate_rotation_matrix` with a function that takes calibration data and returns the eigenvector matrix:

```rust
pub fn spectral_rotation_matrix(calibration: &HeadCalibrationData) -> Vec<f32>
```

This is essentially a transpose of the eigenvector matrix. ~20 lines.

Also need to store per-(layer, head) rotation matrices instead of a single seed-generated matrix. Our current design uses a single seed per layer; SpectralQuant needs unique matrices per (layer, head).

### Priority 3: Water-Fill Allocator (New Module)

Self-contained ~60 lines in new `src/turboquant/waterfill.rs`:

```rust
pub fn allocate_waterfill_bits(
    eigenvalues: &[f32],
    total_bits: usize,
    min_bits: usize,
    max_bits: Option<usize>,
) -> Vec<u8>
```

Direct port of the Python implementation. No external dependencies.

### Priority 4: Per-Dimension Codebooks (Extends `codebook.rs`)

The current `compute_codebook(dim, bits)` assumes Beta distribution. For SpectralQuant, we need:

```rust
pub fn fit_codebook_from_data(samples: &[f32], bits: u8) -> TurboQuantCodebook
```

This runs Lloyd-Max on actual data instead of the Beta PDF. The iteration is the same (centroids → boundaries → centroids), but the PDF integration is replaced by empirical averaging over samples.

~100 lines, extends existing codebook module.

### Priority 5: Variable-Bit Packing (Extends `kv_cache.rs`)

Current `pack_indices`/`unpack_indices` assume uniform bits. Need to handle per-dimension bit widths from water-fill:

```rust
fn pack_variable_bits(indices: &[u8], bits_per_dim: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8>
fn unpack_variable_bits(packed: &[u8], bits_per_dim: &[u8], n_elements: usize) -> Vec<u8>
```

This is more complex than uniform packing. For d_eff=4 with bits=[5,3,2,2], each semantic "row" is 12 bits. Tail is uniform.

~200 lines.

### Priority 6: Selective QJL (Extends `rotation.rs` + `forward.rs`)

Instead of full d×d QJL matrix, generate m×d_eff sign matrix:

```rust
pub fn generate_selective_qjl_matrix(d_eff: usize, n_projections: usize, seed: u64) -> Vec<f32>
```

And modify the attention forward pass to compute QJL correction only on the first d_eff coordinates.

~100 lines across rotation.rs and forward.rs.

### Priority 7: SpectralQuantKVCache (New Struct)

New KV cache variant that stores:
- Packed semantic indices (variable bits, per-dim codebooks)
- Packed tail indices (uniform low bits, shared codebook)
- Per-token norms
- QJL sign bits (d_eff per token, not d)

~400 lines in new `src/turboquant/spectral_cache.rs`.

### Dependency Summary

| Dependency | Current | Needed | Why |
|-----------|---------|--------|-----|
| `nalgebra` | Not present | Yes | Symmetric eigendecomposition |

## 7. Risks and Caveats

### 7.1 Calibration Dependency

SpectralQuant requires a one-time calibration pass. This means:
- **Model-specific**: Each model needs its own calibration. Can't share across architectures.
- **Data-dependent**: Results depend on calibration data distribution. The paper shows CV=3.9% across seeds, which is good but not zero.
- **Version coupling**: If model weights change (fine-tuning, LoRA merge), recalibration may be needed.
- **Cold start**: First deployment needs ~15 seconds before compression is available. During this window, fall back to TurboQuant.

### 7.2 Head Dimension Sensitivity

The d_eff ≈ 4 result is at d_h = 128. For our draft model with d_h = 4:
- d_eff ≈ 4 means everything is "semantic" — no tail to exploit
- SpectralQuant degenerates to TurboQuant with slightly better codebooks
- Not worth the calibration cost for tiny models

The method is valuable only for d_h ≥ 64 (production models).

### 7.3 Value Compression

The paper's d_eff ≈ 4 applies to **keys only**. Values have d_eff ≈ 40–55, meaning:
- Value compression can't use aggressive tail truncation
- The 5.95× compression headline is mostly from key compression
- Value compression improvement over TurboQuant is smaller

Our implementation must handle key and value calibration independently.

### 7.4 Memory Overhead

Per-(layer, head) calibration data storage:
- Eigenvectors: d×d × f32 = 128² × 4 = 64 KB per head
- For 32 layers × 32 heads = 1024 heads: 64 MB total
- This is static and can be memory-mapped, but it's non-trivial

### 7.5 Eigendecomposition Numerical Stability

For nearly-singular covariance matrices, eigendecomposition can produce:
- Negative eigenvalues (numerical noise)
- Near-zero eigenvalues that blow up in water-fill
- Eigenvector orthogonality drift

Mitigations from the source code: eigenvalue clamping (eps = 1e-12), float64 for calibration computations, validation of orthogonality.

### 7.6 Variable-Bit Packing Complexity

Uniform bit packing is trivial (just shift and OR). Variable-bit packing from water-fill requires:
- Bit-level addressing (not byte-aligned)
- Different pack/unpack logic per semantic dimension
- More complex GPU kernel if we port to WGSL

This is the most fiddly engineering challenge.

### 7.7 Reproducibility Concerns

The paper claims NeurIPS 2026 submission. The README has extensive experiment-to-result traceability (44 JSON files tracing to 21 scripts). However:
- Experiments ran on NVIDIA B200 — we have Mac hardware
- Some experiments require HF_TOKEN for gated models
- The 10-seed CI has p=0.031 — significant but barely

### 7.8 Patent/License

The code is MIT licensed. The paper is from Sentra (commercial entity) + MIT. No patent encumbrance noted, but the calibrated eigenbasis approach is specific enough that Freedom-to-Operate should be considered for commercial use.

## 8. Verdict

### Should We Implement?

**Yes, but in phases.**

| Phase | What | Value | Effort |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| **Phase 1** | Water-fill allocator (standalone) | +0.018 cosine at b=2 on top of any rotation | 2 days |
| **Phase 2** | Calibration pipeline + spectral rotation | +0.25 cosine over random rotation | 1 week |
| **Phase 3** | Per-dim codebooks + selective QJL | Remaining quality gap + 2× speedup | 1 week |
| **Phase 4** | Variable-bit KV cache storage | Full compression ratio benefit | 3 days |
| **Phase 5** | WGSL attention kernel | GPU-accelerated two-regime attention | 1 week |

### Phase 1 is the Quick Win

The water-fill allocator is ~60 lines of pure Rust with no new dependencies. It can be applied on top of our existing random rotation by:
1. Running a lightweight calibration (just eigenvalue computation, no codebook fitting)
2. Using water-filled bits instead of uniform bits
3. Keeping our existing Beta-distribution codebooks (suboptimal but functional)

This alone gives +0.01–0.02 cosine improvement for negligible cost.

### The Big Prize is Phase 2+3

Spectral rotation + per-dim codebooks + selective QJL together give the headline +0.25–0.38 cosine improvement. This is the difference between "compression-neutral" and "compression-improving" — at b≈3, SpectralQuant on Qwen2.5-7B achieves perplexity 6.98 vs FP16's 6.49, while TurboQuant is at 7.51. That's a 30% reduction in the perplexity gap.

### Honest Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Empirically robust (6 models, 4 architectures, 10-seed CI)
- Theoretically motivated (water-fill from information theory)
- Backward compatible (SpectralQuant with `use_water_fill=False` = v1, with random rotation = TurboQuant)
- Faster than TurboQuant at inference time
- MIT licensed, clean codebase, reproducible experiments

**Weaknesses:**
- Calibration adds deployment complexity
- Only beneficial for head_dim ≥ 64 (not our draft model)
- Value compression is still near-full-rank
- Variable-bit packing is engineering-heavy
- No perplexity/LongBench on all models yet (preliminary n=5 on Llama)

**What we should NOT claim:**
- "3% is all you need" is for keys only, not values
- 5.95× compression requires both key and value compression with aggressive settings
- The 2.2× speedup is Python-measured; our Rust implementation may see less relative gain

### Bottom Line

SpectralQuant is the strongest known improvement over TurboQuant for KV cache compression. It is well-motivated, well-tested, and the code is clean enough to port. The phased approach lets us start with the easy wins (water-fill allocator) and progress to the full system when we deploy production models with d_h ≥ 64.

For microgpt-rs specifically: implement Phase 1 (water-fill) immediately as it's nearly free. Plan Phase 2–4 for when we integrate larger models. Phase 5 (WGSL kernel) depends on riir-gpu roadmap.
