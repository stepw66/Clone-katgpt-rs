## TL;DR

Canvas engineering declares a **typed schema** (regions, their connectivity, temporal frequencies, loss roles) and a **compiler** lowers it to attention masks + loss weights over a stock pretrained backbone. The headline empirical results (1.73× parameter efficiency, 350K-frozen beats 11.7M-unfrozen, cortical R²=0.825) are **training-dependent** — they require training the DiT *within* the declared structure. The **modelless-distillable value** is narrower and architectural:

1. **The compiler itself** — `CanvasSchema → CanvasLayout (region index sets) + CanvasTopology (directed connection graph) → attention mask + loss weight mask`. Pure structure compilation, zero gradient descent.
2. **Reachability-as-causal-semantics** — for a binary mask, an absent edge `a ↛ b` is an **exact marginal independence** in the generative dynamics (the empty-conditioning case of d-separation); one denoiser pass with L blocks moves information along paths of length ≤ L; K sampling steps compose to horizon K·L. This is a graph-theoretic guarantee that holds *by construction*, not by regularization.
3. **`transfer_distance`** — semantic-type compatibility via frozen embeddings (camera vs joint-angles distance), making modality compatibility a computable scalar instead of a judgment call.
4. **Schema-mediated latent exchange** — two models that share a schema can exchange latent state directly (no re-encoding) because the schema fixes what every position means. This is a freeze/thaw pattern.

**Distilled for katgpt-rs (modelless, inference-time):** a generic `CanvasSchema` compiler + `reachability_horizon` primitive + `transfer_distance` scalar. No game IP, no chain IP, no shard IP. The compiler emits an `AttentionMaskSpec` (consumable by the existing AC-Prefix / VortexFlow mask builders) and a `LossWeightMask` (consumable by training-time callers; at inference only the mask is used). The looped-attention half of the paper is **already distilled** (Research 097 → Plan 136 `LoopMode::TrainingFree`; Research 266 → FPRM Gain) and is NOT re-distilled here.

**Verdict: GOAT.** The compiler + reachability semantics is a novel modelless primitive connecting ≥3 pillars (DEC topology, HLA per-entity latent state, latent_functor typed programs, AC-Prefix masks, freeze/thaw exchange). But (a) the constituent sub-primitives largely ship (`region_subspace_bridge` Plan 416, AC-Prefix Plan 313, StillPerceiver, `LoopMode::TrainingFree`); (b) the headline empirical value is training-dependent and requires riir-train to validate; (c) the reachability semantics, while elegant, is a reframing of "sparse attention = causal graph" that we implicitly already use. It is a **unifying abstraction** (a type system for latent state), not a new empirical capability class at the modelless level. A fusion idea (canvas × DEC reachability × region_subspace × freeze/thaw schema exchange) is flagged as a potential Super-GOAT **if** a defend-wrong PoC proves the compiled canvas improves per-NPC behavior modellessly over the un-unified constituents — tracked in `.issues/043`. The modelless compiler ships; the empirical Super-GOAT claim waits for a PoC.

## 1. Paper Core Findings

### 1.1 The canvas (§2.1)

A canvas is a 3D spatiotemporal grid `(T, H, W)` of `d`-dim latent positions, flattened into the token sequence of a diffusion transformer (DiT). A `CanvasLayout` partitions it into named regions; each `RegionSpec` carries bounds, a temporal period (so a `period=4` "thought" region coexists with a `period=1` "perception" region on one canvas), `is_output` + `loss_weight` (type-directed loss codegen), an optional `semantic_type` with a frozen embedding, and a `default_attn` function family.

### 1.2 Topology = the causal graph = the attention mask (§2.2 — the load-bearing claim)

A `CanvasTopology` is a directed multigraph of cross-attention operations. Each `Connection(src, dst)` licenses `src` tokens to query `dst` keys/values. **The absence of an edge is a hard prohibition, not a soft prior.** Reverse diffusion applies the denoiser to the full canvas at every step, so which regions can influence which under iteration is exactly the topology's transitive closure. Declaring the topology therefore declares a causal interaction graph over the generative dynamics.

Convenience constructors: `dense` (fully connected, the degenerate standard-transformer case), `isolated` (block-diagonal), `hub_spoke` (shared coordinator), `causal_chain` (A→B→C), `causal_temporal` (same-frame self + previous-frame cross, no future leakage).

### 1.3 Core mathematics (§2.3 — four small pieces)

1. **Regions are index sets.** Region `r` with bounds `(t0,t1,h0,h1,w0,w1)` owns `I_r = {tHW+hW+w : ...}`. Struct-offset arithmetic.
2. **Topology compiles to a mask.** Edges lower to `M ∈ R^{N×N}_{≥0}`: `M_ij = max_k w_k · 1[i∈I_{r_k}] · 1[j∈I_{s_k}] · A_τ(t(i),t(j))` where `A_τ` is the temporal alignment predicate. Per-edge cross-attention: `Y_{I_r} += w · softmax(Q_{I_r} K^T_{I_s}/√d) V_{I_s}`. Binary mask (w∈{0,1}) coincides with the monolithic form (add `log M` to logits with `log 0 = -∞`).
3. **Loss participation is a weight vector.** `ω_i = Σ_r 1[i∈I_r] · loss_weight_r · 1[is_output_r]`. Training minimizes position-weighted denoising loss; context positions are clamped (inpainting-style conditioning).
4. **Reachability is the causal statement.** Information-flow graph `G` has arc `s→r` for every connection (`r` queries `s`). One denoiser pass with L blocks moves info along paths ≤ L; K sampling steps compose to horizon K·L. **Load-bearing direction (exact, by construction):** if `G` has no directed path `a→b`, then `a` cannot influence `b`'s denoised value — exact marginal independence (empty-conditioning d-separation). Converse is bounded, not guaranteed.

### 1.4 A type system, literally (§2.4 — Table 1)

| Type concept | Canvas equivalent | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Struct field (offset+size) | Region bounds | `region_indices()` |
| Field annotation (period, loss_weight, sem. type) | `RegionSpec` | — |
| Pointer / reference | `Connection` | `CanvasTopology` |
| Function signature | Topology + fn | `attention_ops()` |
| Type-directed codegen | Loss mask | `loss_weight_mask()` |
| ABI compatibility | Schema compat | `compatible_regions()` |
| Coercion cost | Transfer distance | `transfer_distance()` |

Two models sharing a schema can exchange latent state directly — no tokenization, no re-encoding — because the schema fixes what every position means. Across differing schemas, a region can declare its modality meaning as a string + fixed embedding, making modality compatibility a computable distance.

### 1.5 Attention function types (§2.5)

17 registered function families: dot-product (`cross_`, `linear_`, `sigmoid_attention`), gating (`gated`), compression (`perceiver`, `pooling`), transfer (`copy`), state-space (`mamba`, `rwkv`), convolution (`hyena`), sparse (`local_`, `sparse_attention`), meta (`none`, `random_fixed`, `mixture`). Resolution: `connection.fn → region.default_attn → global cross_attention`.

### 1.6 Compilation: entity schema → canvas (§3)

The compiler accepts typed entity declarations (nested Python dataclasses) and flattens the entity/relationship graph into layout + topology. **Every nested type automatically receives a coarse-grained field** — a compressed representation that bottlenecks all cross-level attention. 50 vehicles under dense cross-attention would cost O(50² × fields²); under coarse-graining each interacts through its 4×4 summary → O(50 × 16). Deep nesting chains the bottlenecks: `us.macro.gdp → cn.macro.inflation` is forced through `us.macro → us → regime → cn → cn.macro`. Hierarchical abstraction is a topological consequence, not an emergent hope.

The program layer (v2) adds process semantics per region: family (observation/state/memory/residual/action), carrier (deterministic/diffusive/filter/memory/residual), clock (periodic or event-triggered with composable firing rules like `Or(periodic(4), on("err.prediction", gt=0.5))`), compile mode (runtime/freeze/constant/export).

### 1.7 Empirical record (§5 — HONESTLY TRAINING-DEPENDENT)

CogVideoX-2B on BridgeData V2: 26 experiments, 236 runs.
- **Looped attention:** 3-loop frozen (350K trainable params) beats every unfrozen condition (11.7M). 1.73× parameter efficiency (p<0.001). Loop representations converge toward fixed points (cosine to loop 1: 0.926→0.996).
- **Calibration findings (honest, not narrative):** (a) looped-attention benefit at this scale is weight-sharing regularization, NOT detectable iterative reasoning; (b) flat-canvas co-residence **degraded** joint prediction by 19% (p<0.0001) — binding must be declared, not hoped for; (c) loss is nearly insensitive to token allocation (α=0.011: doubling a region's tokens moves loss 0.8%) — canvas design is forgiving.
- **Cortical world model:** 23 brain regions (Destrieux atlas) wired by 42 known cortical pathways; recovers TRIBE-v2-estimated cortical dynamics at R²=0.825 using 19.6% of possible connections. Ablation: at 135 features a fully dense model matches the cortical one — topology is a convergence prior, not a capacity advantage.

### 1.8 Open problems (§6)

- **Representation stability (the linchpin):** everything interoperable rests on a platonic-representation claim that identical declared structure induces predictably aligned latent geometry across seeds/datasets/backbones. Plausible, unproven.
- **Binding:** whether declared topology recovers/exceeds independent-model performance is the decisive ablation.
- **Scale:** all evidence at 2B params and robot-video scale.
- **Learned topology:** today the graph is authored; propose/prune edges under sparsity pressure is the natural continuation.

## 2. Distillation (modelless, inference-time)

### 2.1 Training-dependent vs modelless split (the honest cut)

| Paper component | Modelless? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| The compiler (`schema → layout + topology → mask + loss weights`) | **YES** | Pure structure compilation. Zero gradient descent. |
| Reachability = exact marginal independence | **YES** | Graph-theoretic guarantee, holds by construction for binary masks. |
| `transfer_distance` (semantic type compatibility) | **YES** | Frozen-embedding cosine; no training. |
| Schema-mediated latent exchange (same-schema models swap latents) | **YES** | A freeze/thaw pattern; structure is fixed, content is exchanged. |
| Coarse-grained bottleneck construction | **YES (structure)** / **NO (content)** | The bottleneck *layout* is declared; the *summary content* is learned. |
| Looped attention (frozen DiT blocks iterated K× with zero-init learned embeddings) | **PARTIAL** | The zero-init learned embeddings require training. The frozen-block iteration itself is `LoopMode::TrainingFree` (Plan 136). |
| 1.73× parameter efficiency | **NO** | Requires training the DiT within the declared structure. |
| 350K-frozen beats 11.7M-unfrozen | **NO** | Training result. |
| Cortical R²=0.825 | **NO** | Training result. |
| Flat-canvas 19% degradation without declared topology | **NO (it's a loss)** | Applying a mask to an untrained-for-it backbone degrades performance. |

**The modelless value is the compiler + reachability semantics + transfer_distance + schema exchange. The empirical headline value is training-dependent.** Applying a declared-topology mask to a frozen backbone that was NOT trained within it is a documented **loss** (paper §5 calibration finding #2). The modelless primitive therefore ships the *compilation* and the *guarantee*; the *behavioral gain* requires riir-train.

### 2.2 §3.5 modelless-unblock check (mandatory before any riir-train deferral)

The paper's headline gains appear to need training. Exhausting the three modelless paths:

1. **Freeze/thaw snapshot correction** — can a frozen snapshot + thaw recover the gain? **NO.** The gain comes from training the network to *use* the declared topology. A frozen untrained-for-it backbone degrades by 19% (paper §5). Freeze/thaw can exchange schema-compatible latents but cannot make an untrained backbone respect a topology it never learned.
2. **Raw/lora reader-writer hot-swap** — can a deterministically constructed LoRA enforce the topology? **PARTIAL.** The topology is a *mask* (hard prohibition), not a weight. A reader-LoRA could *approximate* the mask softly, but the paper's reachability guarantee requires a *binary* mask (absent edge = exact independence). A soft LoRA approximation breaks the guarantee. So the LoRA path gives an approximation, not the exact guarantee.
3. **Latent-space correction** — can a dot-product projection + sigmoid gate enforce region structure? **PARTIAL.** This is essentially what `region_subspace_bridge` (Plan 416) already does — it projects NPC latent state onto region centroids + local axes. But that's region-conditioned *steering*, not declared *causal topology* with reachability guarantees.

**Conclusion:** the modelless paths can APPLY declared structure and can EXCHANGE schema-compatible latents, but they cannot ACHIEVE the paper's empirical parameter-efficiency / cortical-fit gains without training the network within the declared topology. The training dependency is genuine for the empirical headline. The modelless primitive (compiler + reachability) ships regardless, because it is structure compilation, not a behavioral claim.

### 2.3 Vocabulary translation (paper ↔ codebase) — MANDATORY before novelty claim

| Paper term | Codebase-equivalent | Verified shipped? |
|---|---|---|
| "canvas" / "structured latent space" | typed latent state, HLA 8-dim, `ZoneGeometryPod` 8-lane, `RegionSubspaceField` K-region | **YES (pieces)** — no unified "canvas" type |
| "region" / `RegionSpec` / `region_indices()` | `RegionSubspaceBridge::apply_to_zones_batch(region_indices)`, `ZoneGeometryPod` lanes | **YES (pieces)** — region-conditioned steering ships (Plan 416) |
| "topology" / `Connection` / `CanvasTopology` | sparse attention pattern, `AttentionMaskSpec`, AC-Prefix mask, VortexFlow routing | **YES (pieces)** — no unified topology-as-graph compiler |
| "attention mask" / "causal interaction graph" | AC-Prefix `AcPrefixMask`, DFlash non-causal mask, causal masks | **YES (pieces)** — mask builders ship (Plan 313) |
| "coarse-grained field" / "hierarchical bottleneck" | Egg/Shell bridge (pillar 1), StillPerceiver (Plan 245), perceiver compression | **YES (specific instances)** — no generic "bottleneck-at-every-nesting-level" primitive |
| "schema" / "type system" / "ABI" | `types.rs` decoupled structs, latent_functor typed programs, Analytic Lattice entity encoders | **YES (pieces)** — no unified schema compiler |
| "transfer_distance" / "semantic_type" | schema-centroid cosine (Plan 237), Rosetta neurons best-buddies, dot-product projection | **NO** — no semantic-type-distance primitive |
| "looped attention" / "universal transformer" | `LoopMode::WeightShared` (Plan 108), `LoopMode::TrainingFree` (Plan 136), FPRM (R266) | **YES — fully distilled** |
| "reachability" / "d-separation" / "marginal independence" | DEC `exterior_derivative`, `CellComplex` paths, Viable Manifold Graph transitive closure | **YES (graph substrate)** — no reachability-on-attention-mask primitive |
| "compile_schema" / "compiler" | ProgramAsWeights spec-compile (R229), Percepta C→WASM→weights, Analytic Lattice entity→lattice | **YES (parallel axes)** — no schema→layout+topology compiler |
| "schema-mediated latent exchange" | freeze/thaw (`MerkleFrozenEnvelope`), `LoRAWeightVersion`, `CommittedFieldBlend` BLAKE3 commit | **YES (freeze/thaw substrate)** — no schema-keyed exchange |

### 2.4 Prior-art surface — what already ships (verified grep + read)

1. **`riir-ai/crates/riir-engine/src/latent_functor/region_subspace_bridge.rs`** (Issue 424, wires Plan 416) — zone-conditioned two-mode NPC personality steering. `apply_to_zones_batch(region_indices, centroid_alpha, local_offsets)`. Centroid interpolation + local subspace offset. Pre-discovered MFA artifact `{μ_k, W_k, log π_k, Ψ^{-1}}` applied modellessly. **This is the region concept, at per-NPC latent-state granularity.** Ships declared *regions* but NOT declared *causal topology* between regions.
2. **Plan 313 (AC-Prefix)** — `AcPrefixMask` builder, three-region attention rule, branch-free `attends(i,j)`, bit-packed. Ships the mask-builder primitive for a specific topology (xc-bidirectional | causal-everywhere-else).
3. **Plan 136 (`LoopMode::TrainingFree`)** + Research 097 — K-stage Runge-Kutta β=0.5 sub-stepping on frozen blocks. The looped-attention half of the paper is fully distilled and shipped.
4. **Plan 245 (StillKV StillPerceiver)** — perceiver bottleneck as one of the 17 function families.
5. **Research 311 / Plan 330 (Analytic Lattice Encoder/Decoder)** — compile typed entity schema (Quest/Player/Boss/Zone) → typed-lattice coordinate → compose functional-attention operators. Closest cousin. Encoder half found redundant (`FourierEncoder::encode_*_into` ships). Novel: `compose_chain`, `batch_compose_chain`, ASOC cascade.
6. **katgpt-core `dec/`** — `exterior_derivative` (d), `codifferential` (δ), `hodge_decompose`, `CellComplex`, `CochainField`. The graph/topology substrate for reachability semantics.
7. **Research 229 (ProgramAsWeights)** — spec→compile. We compile specs into symbolic constraints (bitmap), they compile into neural weights. Parallel axis, not the same primitive.
8. **`MerkleFrozenEnvelope` / `CommittedFieldBlend`** — freeze/thaw + BLAKE3 commitment substrate for schema-mediated latent exchange.

**The gap (Q1):** no unified `CanvasSchema → CanvasLayout + CanvasTopology → AttentionMaskSpec + LossWeightMask` compiler; no `reachability_horizon(topology, L, K)` primitive; no `transfer_distance(region_a, region_b)` scalar. These three are genuinely missing.

### 2.5 Fusion — what novel combination does this enable?

**Fusion idea (novelty TBD — needs PoC before Super-GOAT verdict, tracked in `.issues/043`):**

> Canvas Engineering compiler × DEC reachability × `region_subspace_bridge` × freeze/thaw schema-mediated exchange × HLA per-NPC latent state → "A typed NPC cognitive stack where each NPC's latent state is a **compiled canvas** with declared causal topology (perception → affect → action, memory ↔ affect), reachability guarantees (perception cannot influence action without traversing affect, by construction), and schema-mediated freeze/thaw exchange (two NPCs with the same cognitive schema can swap latent state directly)."

The NEW capability this fusion would produce: **declared causal topology with reachability guarantees on per-NPC latent state, plus schema-keyed latent exchange.** None of the constituents alone does this:
- `region_subspace_bridge` does region-conditioned steering, NOT declared causal topology between regions.
- AC-Prefix does mask building, NOT schema compilation.
- DEC does topology/reachability, NOT on per-NPC attention masks.
- Freeze/thaw does exchange, NOT schema-keyed.

**But:** whether the compiled canvas + reachability semantics improves per-NPC behavior modellessly over the un-unified constituents is **unproven**. The paper's evidence is that declared topology helps *when trained within*; the modelless application (apply mask to frozen backbone) is a documented 19% loss. So the fusion's behavioral value at the modelless level is a hypothesis, not a proven gain. Per §3.6, a defend-wrong PoC in `riir-ai/crates/riir-poc/` is the right next step before any Super-GOAT re-evaluation — NOT a Super-GOAT verdict now.

### 2.6 Compute-unit translation (the R368 lesson — does NOT trigger here)

The paper has no "N LLM calls/step" structure. Its compute unit is "one DiT denoiser pass over the canvas." For us, the analog compute unit is "one latent_functor application over the NPC's typed latent state." No false-PASS risk from conflating LLM-as-implementation with LLM-as-mechanism — the paper is architecture, not agent orchestration.

## 3. Verdict — GOAT

**Tiers (high → low):**

| Tier | Criteria | Routing |
|---|---|---|
| **Super-GOAT** | Novel mechanism + new capability class + product selling point + force multiplier (≥2 pillars) | Open primitive + private guide + plans |
| **GOAT** | Provable gain over existing approach, but not a new class of capability | Plan + implement, feature flag + benchmark |
| **Gain** | Incremental improvement, useful but not headline-worthy | Plan only, behind feature flag |
| **Pass** | Not relevant, OR training-only (→ riir-train note, stop) | One-line note |

**Verdict: GOAT.**

**One-line reasoning:** The `CanvasSchema` compiler + `reachability_horizon` + `transfer_distance` is a novel modelless primitive (structure compilation, zero gradient descent) with a provable correctness property (absent edge = exact marginal independence by construction) that unifies ≥3 existing pillars (DEC topology, region-conditioned latent state, AC-Prefix masks, freeze/thaw exchange); but (a) the constituent sub-primitives largely ship, (b) the headline empirical value (parameter efficiency, cortical fit) is training-dependent and requires riir-train to validate, (c) the reachability semantics is an elegant reframing of sparse-attention-as-causal-graph rather than a new mechanism. It is a unifying type-system abstraction for latent state, not a new empirical capability class at the modelless level.

### 3.1 Novelty gate (Q1–Q4)

- **Q1 (No prior art for the unified compiler?): YES.** Grep across all 5 repos (both paper vocab and codebase vocab) confirms: no `CanvasSchema`/`CanvasLayout`/`CanvasTopology`/`compile_schema`/`transfer_distance`/`reachability_horizon` type. Pieces ship (`region_subspace_bridge`, AC-Prefix, DEC, StillPerceiver, Analytic Lattice); the unified compiler does not.
- **Q2 (New class of behavior?): PARTIAL → NO at the modelless level.** The compiler enables "pointability" (typed, pointable latent state) and "declared causal topology with reachability guarantees." But the runtime behavior (sparse attention over typed regions) is something the constituents already do; the NEW thing is the compilation + guarantee, which is a structuring/refactoring gain, not a behavioral one. Critically, the paper's own evidence shows modelless application (mask on untrained backbone) is a 19% LOSS — so the modelless behavioral claim is unproven and currently negative.
- **Q3 (Product selling point?): YES (architectural), NO (empirical, modelless).** "Our NPC cognitive stack has a typed schema compiler with declared causal topology and reachability guarantees" is a real architectural selling point. "And it improves NPC behavior modellessly" is unproven.
- **Q4 (Force multiplier?): YES.** Connects to DEC topology, HLA per-entity latent state, latent_functor typed programs, AC-Prefix masks, freeze/thaw schema exchange, region_subspace steering. ≥4 pillars/systems.

**Q2 fails at the modelless level → not Super-GOAT now.** The fusion idea (§2.5) is flagged as a potential Super-GOAT if a PoC proves modelless behavioral gain — tracked in `.issues/043`. Per §1.5, "candidate" language is avoided: this is a GOAT with a tracked fusion follow-up, not a deferred Super-GOAT commitment.

### 3.2 MOAT gate per domain (§1.6)

- **katgpt-rs (public engine):** the compiler + reachability + transfer_distance is a **paper-derived fundamental primitive** (generic math, no game/chain/shard semantics). Ships behind feature flag `canvas_schema`. GOAT-gate decides promote/demote. **In scope.**
- **riir-ai (private runtime):** the fusion (typed NPC cognitive stack) is **pillar-level if the PoC passes**. Until then, deferred — the guide is NOT created now (GOAT verdict, not Super-GOAT).
- **riir-chain / riir-neuron-db:** schema-mediated latent exchange touches freeze/thaw, but the primary value is the compiler (katgpt-rs). No reroute needed.
- **riir-train:** the empirical validation (train DiT within declared topology, measure parameter efficiency at our scale) is a genuine riir-train follow-up. Noted, not blocked.

### 3.3 §3.6 defend-wrong PoC — NOT triggered now

The §3.6 PoC rule triggers for PASS verdicts that downgrade on "runtime analog already ships" OR for quality-parity claims. This verdict is **GOAT** (not PASS) and makes **no quality-parity claim** — it explicitly states the modelless behavioral gain is unproven and currently negative (paper's 19% degradation finding). The compiler primitive ships on its structural/correctness merits (reachability guarantee by construction), not on a behavioral-parity claim. A PoC is the right *follow-up* for the fusion's potential Super-GOAT re-evaluation (`.issues/043`), not a blocker for the GOAT.

---

## 4. Distilled primitive — what ships in katgpt-rs

Open primitive (Plan 419), feature flag `canvas_schema`, opt-in until GOAT gate:

```rust
// crates/katgpt-core/src/canvas/mod.rs (new module)

/// A typed region of the canvas: bounds + temporal period + loss role + semantic type.
pub struct RegionSpec {
    pub name: &'static str,
    pub bounds: CanvasBounds,        // (t0,t1,h0,h1,w0,w1)
    pub period: u32,                 // temporal update frequency
    pub is_output: bool,
    pub loss_weight: f32,
    pub semantic_type: Option<SemanticType>,  // frozen embedding for transfer_distance
    pub default_attn: AttentionFnFamily,
}

/// A directed connection: src queries dst. Absence = hard prohibition (exact marginal independence).
pub struct Connection {
    pub src: RegionId,
    pub dst: RegionId,
    pub weight: f32,                 // binary {0,1} for the reachability guarantee
    pub t_src: Option<i32>,          // temporal offset
    pub t_dst: Option<i32>,
    pub fn_family: Option<AttentionFnFamily>,  // overrides region default
}

pub struct CanvasSchema {
    pub layout: CanvasLayout,        // T, H, W, d_model, regions
    pub topology: CanvasTopology,    // connections
}

/// THE COMPILER. Pure structure, zero gradient descent.
/// schema → (region index sets, attention mask spec, loss weight mask)
pub fn compile_schema(schema: &CanvasSchema) -> CompiledCanvas {
    let region_indices: Vec<IndexSet> = schema.layout.regions.iter()
        .map(|r| region_indices(r)).collect();
    let mask = build_attention_mask(&schema.topology, &region_indices);
    let loss_mask = build_loss_weight_mask(&schema.layout);
    CompiledCanvas { region_indices, mask, loss_mask }
}

/// THE REACHABILITY GUARANTEE.
/// Returns the causal horizon: max path length reachable in K sampling steps × L attention blocks.
/// For binary masks: if no directed path a→b in topology, a cannot influence b (exact marginal independence).
pub fn reachability_horizon(topology: &CanvasTopology, n_blocks: usize, n_steps: usize) -> usize {
    n_blocks * n_steps
}

/// Returns true iff `from` can reach `to` within the horizon (transitive closure check).
pub fn can_reach(topology: &CanvasTopology, from: RegionId, to: RegionId, horizon: usize) -> bool {
    // BFS/DFS on the information-flow graph (arc s→r for connection r queries s)
    transitive_closure_reaches(topology, from, to, horizon)
}

/// Semantic-type compatibility via frozen embeddings (modelless routing scalar).
pub fn transfer_distance(a: &SemanticType, b: &SemanticType) -> f32 {
    1.0 - cosine(a.frozen_embedding(), b.frozen_embedding())
}
```

**Consumers:** the `CompiledCanvas.mask` is an `AttentionMaskSpec` consumable by AC-Prefix / VortexFlow / any sparse-attention path. The `reachability_horizon` / `can_reach` primitives compose with DEC's `CellComplex` path queries. The `transfer_distance` is a standalone routing scalar.

**What does NOT ship here (training-dependent, → riir-train):**
- Training a DiT within the declared topology (the empirical parameter-efficiency path).
- Looped-attention zero-init learned embeddings (already covered by `LoopMode::WeightShared` Plan 108).
- Representation-stability validation across seeds/backbones (paper §6 linchpin, open).

---

## 5. Risks and honest caveats

1. **The modelless behavioral gain is unproven (and currently negative).** The paper's own calibration finding #2: flat-canvas co-residence without declared topology degrades by 19%. Applying a declared-topology mask to a frozen untrained-for-it backbone is a documented loss. The compiler + reachability ships on structural/correctness merits; the behavioral gain requires riir-train. Do NOT claim modelless behavioral parity.
2. **The reachability guarantee requires a binary mask.** Soft masks (weighted edges, LoRA approximations) break the exact marginal independence. The guarantee is `w ∈ {0,1}` only.
3. **The "pointability" selling point assumes representation stability.** Paper §6 names this as the linchpin: identical declared structure must induce predictably aligned latent geometry across seeds/datasets/backbones. Plausible, unproven. Without it, "schema-mediated latent exchange" degrades to "exchange and hope."
4. **Most constituent primitives ship.** The compiler's value is unification + the reachability guarantee, not new constituent capability. A reviewer who greps `region_subspace_bridge` + AC-Prefix + StillPerceiver + `LoopMode::TrainingFree` will correctly observe that the pieces exist; the novel claim is the compiler that binds them + the reachability semantics.
5. **The paper is small-scale (2B params, robot video).** All empirical claims are calibration, not narrative (paper §5 is explicit about this). Do not over-claim.
6. **Looped attention is already distilled.** Research 097 → Plan 136 ships `LoopMode::TrainingFree`. Research 266 (FPRM) is Gain. The looped-attention half of this paper adds nothing over those. This note deliberately does NOT re-distill it.

## 6. Plan

→ `katgpt-rs/.plans/419_canvas_schema_compiler.md` (open primitive: compiler + reachability + transfer_distance, feature flag `canvas_schema`, opt-in until GOAT gate).

**Fusion PoC follow-up:** → `katgpt-rs/.issues/043_canvas_modelless_behavioral_gain_poc.md` (defend-wrong PoC for the §2.5 fusion: does compiled canvas + reachability improve per-NPC behavior modellessly over un-unified constituents? If YES → re-evaluate for Super-GOAT; if NO → stays GOAT, compiler ships on structural merits). **RESOLVED 2026-07-09 — see §7 PoC Addendum below.**

**riir-train follow-up (noted, not blocked):** train a small DiT within a declared NPC-cognitive-stack topology; measure parameter efficiency vs flat baseline at our scale. This is the genuine training dependency for the empirical headline; it lives in riir-train.

---

## 7. PoC Addendum (Issue 043, resolved 2026-07-09)

**Bench:** `riir-ai/crates/riir-poc/benches/canvas_npc_cognitive_stack_modelless.rs`
**Record:** `riir-ai/.benchmarks/043_canvas_npc_cognitive_stack_modelless.md`

**Result: MODELLESS BEHAVIORAL SIGNAL DETECTED, but stays GOAT.**

The canvas `can_reach` gate produces a measurable behavioral difference in a
controlled NPC cognitive-stack toy domain:
- The canvas NPC approaches fake threats (MinD -1.53 vs leaky baseline) — it does
  NOT false-flee from perceptually-identical-but-harmless entities.
- True-flee rate maintained (-0.7pp, negligible).
- Action-affect coherence improved (+0.0978).

But this is a **precision/recall trade-off**, not a new capability class:
- Better when fakes are truly harmless (more exploration, less wasted fleeing).
- Riskier if fakes can become real (less cautious).

**Verdict: Research 398 stays GOAT (not Super-GOAT).** The behavioral signal
supports the canvas compiler's value but does not constitute a new capability
class. `canvas_schema` stays opt-in pending a production consumer.

## TL;DR

Canvas engineering declares a typed schema and compiles it to attention masks + loss weights. The **modelless value** is the compiler + reachability-as-exact-marginal-independence + transfer_distance + schema-mediated latent exchange. The **headline empirical value** (1.73× parameter efficiency, cortical R²=0.825) is training-dependent. Most constituent primitives ship (`region_subspace_bridge`, AC-Prefix, StillPerceiver, `LoopMode::TrainingFree`). **Verdict: GOAT** — the unified `CanvasSchema` compiler is novel and modelless, connects ≥4 pillars, and gives a provable correctness property (reachability by construction); but it is a unifying type-system abstraction, not a new empirical capability class at the modelless level, and the behavioral gain requires riir-train. A fusion PoC (`.issues/043`) tracks potential Super-GOAT re-evaluation. Plan 419 ships the open compiler primitive.
