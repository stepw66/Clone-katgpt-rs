# Research 136: Learn from Your Own Latents — Sample-Complexity Theory

**Source:** arXiv:2605.27734 (Korchinski, Favero, Wyart — EPFL/Cambridge/JHU)
**Date:** 2026-05-28
**Verdict:** ✅ DISTILLABLE — ILC synonym pruning for DDTree search space reduction
**Feature Gate:** `ilc_distill` (after GOAT proof → default-on if no perf hurt)
**Cross-ref:** riir-ai Research 025 (training pipeline), Decision Matrix Plan 170

## Tasks

- [ ] T1: Implement `IlcClusterer` — k-means on cousin context vectors from episode data
- [ ] T2: Implement `SynonymMap` — O(1) lookup for synonym cluster membership at inference time
- [ ] T3: Wire `SynonymMap` into `ScreeningPruner::relevance()` — synonym-aware scoring
- [ ] T4: Wire `SynonymMap` into DDTree — prune synonym branches (same cluster = explore one)
- [ ] T5: GOAT proof — DDTree nodes explored with vs without synonym pruning (Bomber 1000 games)
- [ ] T6: After GOAT — if no perf hurt, make `ilc_distill` default-on

## Core Finding

Token-level SSL (MLM, diffusion) requires O(m^(L+1)) samples to learn hierarchical latent structure.
Latent-prediction SSL (data2vec, JEPA) requires only O(m³) samples — **exponential improvement**, independent of hierarchy depth L.

| Method | Sample Complexity | Depth Dependence |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Supervised classification | O(m^L) | Exponential |
| Token-level SSL (MLM, diffusion) | O(m^(L+1)) | Exponential |
| Latent prediction (data2vec, ILC) | O(m³) | **Independent of L** |

## Key Mechanisms

### 1. Iterative Latent Clustering (ILC)
- Level-by-level: cluster synonym tuples by their "cousin context vectors"
- Synonyms (same parent) have identical context vectors
- Each level costs O(vm³) — same at every depth
- k-means clustering sufficient

### 2. Stacked Latent-Clustering (SLC)
- Neural implementation of ILC: predictor + clusterer modules
- Predictor predicts cousin tokens (cross-entropy)
- Clusterer assigns soft cluster labels (contrastive loss)
- Teacher-student with EMA prevents collapse
- **Local learning suffices** — stop-gradients between modules still achieve O(m³)

### 3. data2vec Analysis
- data2vec **implicitly performs** ILC/SLC's hierarchical clustering
- Phase-by-phase: level-1 latents → enter teacher target → level-2 latents → ...
- EMA teacher acts as "refreshed target" carrying learned latents
- **H-JEPA stacking is redundant** — single data2vec already hierarchical

## What IS Distillable for katgpt-rs

The paper's Algorithm 1 (ILC) produces **synonym clusters** — groups of game states with identical context vectors. This has TWO concrete inference uses:

### 1. DDTree Search Space Reduction

If two DDTree branches lead to states in the same synonym cluster, they're equivalent — explore only one.
This is the same principle as transposition tables in chess engines, but grounded in the paper's provable
O(m³) synonym recovery.

```text
Without ILC: DDTree explores all N branches → N nodes
With ILC:    DDTree explores only C < N unique clusters → C nodes (C ≤ N)
```

For hierarchical data with branching factor m, redundant branches scale as O(m^L). ILC collapses these to O(m³)
unique clusters regardless of depth.

### 2. Synonym-Aware ScreeningPruner

Current `ScreeningPruner::relevance()` scores each candidate independently (pointwise). ILC adds a
pairwise signal: candidates in the same synonym cluster get correlated scores. This is the same upgrade
pattern as Bradley-Terry (pairwise > pointwise).

### Architecture

```text
OFFLINE (once per game domain):
  episode data → IlcClusterer → SynonymMap (lookup table)

ONLINE (inference, hot path):
  SynonymMap::lookup(state) → ClusterId    // O(1), no allocation
  DDTree: skip branches in already-explored clusters
  ScreeningPruner: boost relevance for diverse-cluster candidates
```

This follows the exact same pattern as:
- Fourier spatial hashing: offline frequency tuning → online O(1) lookup
- SpectralQuant: offline eigenvector calibration → online compressed attention
- OCTOPUS: offline octahedral encoding → online KV compression

### Why This Works (Paper Proof)

Theorem 1 (informal): ILC recovers the full non-root hierarchy from O(vm³) samples with probability ≥ 1-δ.
Key property: synonyms (same parent in hierarchy) have IDENTICAL cousin context vectors.
Corollary: once synonym clusters are computed offline, online lookup is exact and O(1).

## What STAYS in riir-ai (Training Pipeline)

The training-time applications (latent-prediction loss for wgpu LoRA, ILC for game hierarchy discovery) live in riir-ai Research 025. The katgpt-rs distillation is the **offline clustering + online inference** path only.

## What We Already Have That This Validates

| Paper Concept | katgpt-rs Equivalent | Status |
|--------------|---------------------|--------|
| Teacher-student EMA | SDAR gated distillation (Plan 072) | ✅ Implemented |
| Hierarchical latent clustering | ROPD rubric criteria (Plan 071) | ✅ Implemented |
| Contrastive clustering loss | Bradley-Terry pairwise ranking | ✅ Implemented |
| Stop-gradient local learning | Freeze/Thaw pipeline (Plan 092) | ✅ Implemented |
| data2vec = implicit hierarchy | VPD variational distillation | ✅ Implemented |

## Theoretical Value

- **Validates SDAR sigmoid gate**: The paper proves latent targets are strictly better than token targets. SDAR's sigmoid-gated teacher representation is a latent target → validates the design.
- **Validates ROPD multi-criterion**: The ILC algorithm clusters by multi-dimensional context vectors. ROPD rubrics are multi-criterion evaluation → same principle.
- **Validates local learning**: Stop-gradients between modules still work → our Freeze/Thaw's per-layer approach is theoretically sound.

## Implementation Pattern

Follows existing modelless distillation pattern (GFlowNet Plan 052, ROPD Plan 071, SDAR Plan 072):

```rust
// Feature-gated module: katgpt-rs-core/src/distill/ilc.rs
#[cfg(feature = "ilc_distill")]
pub mod ilc {
    /// Offline: cluster episode data into synonym groups
    pub struct IlcClusterer { vocab_size: usize, branching: usize, max_depth: usize }
    
    /// Online: O(1) synonym cluster lookup (precomputed, no allocation)
    pub struct SynonymMap { centers: Vec<Vec<[f32; D]>>, labels: Vec<Vec<usize>> }
    
    impl SynonymMap {
        pub fn lookup(&self, state: &[f32], level: usize) -> ClusterId { ... }
        pub fn are_synonyms(&self, a: &[f32], b: &[f32], level: usize) -> bool { ... }
    }
}
```

Integration points:
- `ScreeningPruner::relevance()` — boost diversity across clusters
- DDTree `build_dd_tree` — skip synonym branches
- `BanditPruner` — cluster-aware arm selection

## Open/Close Split

```
katgpt-rs (MIT)                    riir-ai (Private)
─────────────────────              ─────────────────────
trait IlcClusterer                 Per-game hierarchy depth configs
SynonymMap (generic)               Per-game cousin context definitions
kmeans utility                     Episode data → SynonymMap offline pipeline
DDTree synonym pruning             Game-specific cluster-to-strategy mapping
ScreeningPruner integration        Cross-game latent transfer weights
```

## Optimization Skill Alignment

- ✅ Pre-compute lookup table: `SynonymMap` built offline, O(1) reads online
- ✅ Fixed-size arrays: cluster centers `[f32; D]` where D is bounded by vocab_size
- ✅ No hot-loop allocation: `SynonymMap::lookup()` is pure array indexing
- ✅ Batch API: cluster multiple states in one pass (amortize k-means distance computation)
