## TL;DR

SAR projects a weight delta ΔW = W_RL − W_0 onto the base model's SVD spectral subspace, extracting a compact "rewiring matrix" M = UᵀΔWV. The projected delta ΔW* = UMVᵀ retains the reasoning-effective (or personality-effective) component while discarding off-manifold drift. The off-diagonal elements of M represent cross-skill "rewiring" — many-to-one logical synthesis that is the geometric mechanism for compositional reasoning.

**Distilled for katgpt-rs (modelless, inference-time):**

The SAR projection itself is a pure deterministic matrix operation: SVD of the base weights (computed once, offline) + two matrix multiplications to extract M + one reconstruction. No training. The headline result (extract reasoning core from RL deltas) requires trained W_RL → routes to riir-train. But the **modelless residue** — project ANY weight delta (freeze/thaw delta, LoRA overlay, consolidation delta) onto the base's spectral subspace to purify it — is a genuinely novel primitive not shipped anywhere in the 5-repo quintet.

**Verdict: GOAT.** Novel mechanism (Q1 ✓ no prior art), new capability class (Q2 ✓ spectral purification + positive-sum merging), force multiplier (Q4 ✓ connects freeze/thaw + consolidation + LoRA + TIES merging). Q3 (product selling point) needs GOAT-gate validation for NPC-scale deltas before Super-GOAT promotion.

## 1. Paper Core Findings

### 1.1 The Geometric Framework — SVD as Functional Basis

For a pretrained weight matrix W₀ ∈ ℝ^(d_out × d_in), the SVD W₀ = UΣVᵀ decomposes the forward pass into:

- **Information read-in:** right singular vectors vᵢ act as feature detectors (vᵢᵀx)
- **Information read-out:** left singular vectors uᵢ define output directions, weighted by σᵢ

The spectral manifold **S_r(W₀) = span(U ⊗ V)** defines the base model's "functional library" — pretrained atomic skills encoded as singular vector pairs.

### 1.2 Subspace-Aligned Rewiring (SAR)

Given a trained model W_RL and base W₀, the update ΔW = W_RL − W₀ decomposes:

```
ΔW = ΔW* + ΔW⊥

where:
  ΔW*  = P_U · ΔW · P_V = U(UᵀΔWV)Vᵀ = UMVᵀ    (on spectral manifold)
  ΔW⊥  = ΔW − ΔW*                                  (off-manifold residual)
  M    = UᵀΔWV ∈ ℝ^(r×r)                          (rewiring matrix)
```

**Algorithm 1 (SAR):**
1. SVD: W₀ = UΣVᵀ (top-k)
2. Isolate: ΔW ← W_RL − W₀
3. Low-rank: extract top-k component ΔW_k from ΔW
4. Project: M ← UᵀΔW_k V
5. Reconstruct: ΔW* ← UMVᵀ
6. Return: W_SAR ← W₀ + ΔW*

### 1.3 The Rewiring Matrix — Diagonal vs Off-Diagonal

The forward pass of the SAR-projected model is:

```
y = U(Σ + M)Vᵀx = Σᵢ [ (σᵢ + Mᵢᵢ)(vᵢᵀx) + Σ_{j≠i} Mᵢⱼ(vⱼᵀx) ] uᵢ
                     └── rescaling ──┘    └── cross-skill rewiring ──┘
```

- **Diagonal Mᵢᵢ:** rescale isolated pretrained capabilities (amplify/suppress)
- **Off-diagonal Mᵢⱼ (i≠j):** route evidence from skill vⱼ to output uᵢ — **many-to-one logical synthesis**, the geometric mechanism for compositional reasoning

### 1.4 Three Application Uses

| Use | Mechanism | Result |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| **Extraction** | Project RL delta onto base spectral subspace, keep top-1% rank | Preserves >99% Pass@1 using ~0.58% of params; improves Pass@k exploration |
| **Purification** | Project Mix-RL delta onto spectral subspace | Releases suppressed cross-domain capability (+1.48% LCB v5, +0.95% v6 on 32B) |
| **Merging** | Filter each expert delta through spectral geometry before merging | Merged model surpasses best single-domain experts (positive-sum) |

### 1.5 Boundary Cases (§5, Appendix D)

SAR works best in "elicitation regime" — RL that reorganizes existing capabilities:
- **Heavily trained RL (>4000 steps):** recovers ~43% (comparable to early DeepScaleR), not final ~52%. Some rewriting happens beyond the spectral manifold.
- **Code RL from base model:** less compatible — needs domain SFT first to establish conventions.
- **PPO with dense critic rewards:** reduced compatibility — dense rewards push updates off-manifold.

## 2. Distillation

### 2.1 §3.5 Modelless Unblock Protocol — MANDATORY

**The paper's headline (extract reasoning core from RL delta) requires a trained W_RL.** We have no RL training (modelless-first mandate). Before deferring, exhaust the three modelless paths:

| Path | Check | Result |
|------|-------|--------|
| **1. Freeze/thaw correction** | Can a frozen snapshot + spectral projection fix a delta? | **YES** — given two frozen states (W₀, W₁), the delta ΔW = W₁ − W₀ is available modellessly. Project onto W₀'s spectral subspace. The SVD is computed once at freeze time. ✓ MODELLESS |
| **2. Raw/lora reader-writer hot-swap** | Can a deterministically constructed LoRA fix it? | **YES** — ΔW* = UMVᵀ is rank ≤ r, so it IS a low-rank overlay (LoRA). The projection is deterministic (no gradient descent). The reader = U, writer = V, values = M. ✓ MODELLESS |
| **3. Latent-space correction** | Can a dot-product projection fix it? | **N/A** — SAR operates in weight space, not latent space. The mechanism is weight-space SVD projection. |

**§3.5 verdict: MODELLESS-VALIDABLE.** The SAR projection is a deterministic weight-space operation. The inputs (two frozen states, or a base weight + LoRA overlay) are available at inference time. No riir-train deferral.

**Important honest caveat:** The paper proves the mechanism for RL deltas at 1.5B–32B scale. Our modelless application (freeze/thaw deltas, LoRA overlays, consolidation deltas) operates at different scales and different semantics. The spectral concentration property may not hold identically. This needs the GOAT gate.

### 2.2 Where SAR Applies in the 5-Repo Quintet

SAR requires an actual weight **matrix** (d_out × d_in) to SVD-decompose. Three concrete application sites:

| Site | Repo | Matrix | Delta source | Purification target |
|------|------|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| **LoRA reader/writer pairs** | katgpt-rs (Plan 025) | Base weight W₀ (Wq, Wk, Wv, Wo, MLP) | Reader × writer product | Purify LoRA overlay: keep on-manifold, discard off-manifold drift |
| **Full transformer weights** | katgpt-rs | W₀ (attention + MLP linears) | Freeze/thaw delta between two snapshots | Purify personality/capability delta |
| **Consolidation deltas** | riir-neuron-db | Base shard weights | Multi-shard consolidation delta | Spectrally align consolidation to reduce interference |

**Does NOT directly apply to:** `NeuronShard::style_weights[64]` — this is a 64-dim **vector**, not a matrix. The SVD projection requires a matrix. The 64-dim style_weights would need to be reshaped (e.g., 8×8) or embedded in a larger matrix for SAR to apply. This is a known limitation.

### 2.3 Fusion — the Highest-Value Combinations

#### Fusion A: SAR × TIES Merging (Plan 094) — Spectral Upgrade

TIES merging currently uses magnitude-based filtering (trim top-ρ + sign election + disjoint merge). SAR replaces this with spectral filtering: project each task vector onto the base SVD subspace before merging.

```
TIES (current):   trim(τ) → elect_sign → disjoint_merge
SAR merge:        project(τ, base_SVD) → merge_projected → reconstruct
```

The paper proves SAR merging produces models that **surpass the best single-domain experts** (Table 4) — a capability TIES cannot achieve. This is a direct upgrade to Plan 094.

#### Fusion B: SAR × SOPTV (Plan 264 / Research 231) — Complementary Decomposition

**Fascinating tension:** SOPTV (Research 231) found that OPD distillation deltas are **off-principal** (p₁₀ ≤ 1% projection onto top-10% singular directions). SAR finds that RL deltas' reasoning-effective component is **on-principal** (projects onto base SVD subspace).

These are **complementary, not contradictory:**
- OPD (distillation) deltas move off-principal → student diverges from teacher's principal directions
- RL (reward optimization) deltas stay on-principal → reasoning is elicited by rewiring existing skills

**Fusion idea:** decompose any weight delta into TWO components:
```
ΔW = ΔW_on_principal (SAR)  +  ΔW_off_principal (SOPTV)
```
The on-principal component captures capability rewiring (SAR); the off-principal component captures task-specific adaptation (SOPTV). Store both compactly. This is a **two-component weight delta decomposition** that neither paper alone provides.

#### Fusion C: SAR × Freeze/Thaw (riir-neuron-db) — Purified Personality Snapshots

When freezing a personality snapshot, project the delta onto the base shard's spectral subspace. Store only the compact rewiring matrix M (r×r) in the `MerkleFrozenEnvelope` instead of the full delta. This:
- Reduces freeze storage (M is ~0.58% of params at top-1% rank)
- Purifies personality changes (removes drift/noise)
- Makes personality merging positive-sum (spectral-aligned deltas are compatible)

#### Fusion D: SAR × LoRA Hot-Swap (Plan 025) — Spectral LoRA

When applying a reader/writer LoRA pair, project the LoRA product onto the base weight's spectral subspace. The result is a "spectral LoRA" — a deterministically purified overlay that keeps only the on-manifold component. More compatible across domains than the raw LoRA.

## 3. Verdict

### Tier: GOAT

**One-line reasoning:** Novel modelless primitive (spectral projection of weight deltas — no prior art across 5 repos) with a new capability class (spectral purification + positive-sum merging) that connects to ≥4 existing pillars (freeze/thaw, consolidation, LoRA, TIES merging). Not Super-GOAT because Q3 (product selling point for NPC-scale deltas) needs GOAT-gate validation.

### Novelty Gate (§1.5)

| Q | Criterion | Answer | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| Q1 | No prior art? | **YES** | Grep across all 5 repos for `spectral.*(project\|subspace\|align)`, `SVD.*(project\|delta)`, `rewiring matrix`, `subspace.aligned`. Closest cousins: TIES (Plan 094, magnitude-based), SOPTV (Plan 264, off-principal sparse storage), Prism (Plan 216, channel masks), LoRA-Muon (R238, gauge rebalancing). **None** project weight deltas onto base SVD spectral subspaces. |
| Q2 | New class of behavior? | **YES** | "Spectral purification of weight deltas" + "positive-sum merging via spectral alignment" are new capability classes. No incumbent can do positive-sum merging (TIES is zero-sum at best). |
| Q3 | Product selling point? | **PARTIAL** | Can state: "Our freeze/thaw runtime spectrally purifies personality deltas, so NPC personality drift is eliminated and personality merging is positive-sum." But this is **unvalidated** for NPC-scale deltas (64-dim style_weights, small LoRA overlays). Paper proves for 1.5B–32B LLM weights. |
| Q4 | Force multiplier? | **YES** | Connects to: freeze/thaw (P2 neuron-db), consolidation (Raven/δ-Mem), LoRA hot-swap (Plan 025), TIES merging (Plan 094), ArchetypeBlendShard (Plan 336). |

**Q3 is the gate.** If the GOAT gate validates spectral concentration for NPC-scale deltas → Super-GOAT promotion path opens. Until then, GOAT.

### MOAT Gate (§1.6)

| Domain | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **katgpt-rs** (public engine) | **In scope.** The primitive is a paper-derived fundamental spectral matrix operation. Ships behind feature flag `spectral_rewire`. GOAT gate decides promote-to-default. ✓ |
| **riir-neuron-db** (private shards) | **Application target.** Freeze/thaw purification + consolidation alignment are shard-internal. The open primitive (spectral_rewire function) lives in katgpt-rs; the shard-specific application (purified MerkleFrozenEnvelope) lives here. |
| **riir-ai** (private runtime) | **Application target.** LoRA hot-swap purification + personality merge upgrade are runtime concerns. |

### §3.5 Modelless Unblock — MODELLESS-VALIDABLE

The SAR projection is deterministic. No riir-train deferral. The three modelless paths:
1. Freeze/thaw correction: ✓ (project delta between two frozen states)
2. Raw/lora hot-swap: ✓ (ΔW* = UMVᵀ is a deterministically constructed low-rank overlay)
3. Latent correction: N/A (weight-space operation)

**Honest boundary:** The paper's "extraction" use case (extract reasoning core from RL delta) requires a trained W_RL — that specific application routes to riir-train. The modelless residue (spectral projection of ANY weight delta) is what we distill.

## 7. Honest Caveats and Limitations

1. **Scale mismatch.** The paper proves SAR for 1.5B–32B parameter transformers. Our NPC-scale weight matrices are much smaller (LoRA overlays, 64-dim style_weights). The spectral concentration property (reasoning-effective component in top-1% rank) may not hold identically. The GOAT gate must validate this.

2. **Vector vs matrix.** `NeuronShard::style_weights[64]` is a vector, not a matrix. SAR requires a matrix to SVD-decompose. Direct application requires reshaping (8×8) or a different formulation. The most direct application is to LoRA overlays and full transformer weights, which ARE matrices.

3. **No RL deltas.** The paper's headline "extraction" use case (extract reasoning core from RL delta) requires trained W_RL. We have no RL training. The modelless residue is spectral projection of freeze/thaw and LoRA deltas — a different, unvalidated application.

4. **The SOPTV tension.** Research 231 found OPD deltas are off-principal. SAR finds RL deltas' reasoning component is on-principal. These study different training regimes (distillation vs RL). For our modelless deltas (freeze/thaw, LoRA), the geometric signature is unknown — could be either. Fusion B (two-component decomposition) hedges this.

5. **Precision sensitivity.** The paper notes SAR is sensitive to numerical precision (FP32 for SVD, FP16 for storage). Our runtime uses mixed precision. The GOAT gate must check precision robustness.
