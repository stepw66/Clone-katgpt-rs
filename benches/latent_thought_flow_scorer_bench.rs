//! Cost-Aware Reward-Proportional Latent Trajectory Scorer — GOAT Gate Benchmark
//! (Issue 030, Research 263, arxiv:2606.16222 — Latent Thought Flow).
//!
//! Distills the *inference-time* slice of Latent Thought Flow (LTF) modellessly:
//! the paper's GFlowNet training (EW-SubTB, reference-prior, LoRA-on-latent-head)
//! is out of scope (→ riir-train). What's left is a fusion of FIVE existing
//! primitives into one scorer over N latent-thought trajectories:
//!
//! 1. `LatentThoughtKernel`            — trajectory generator (Plan 276)
//! 2. `self_advantage_margin`           — teacher-free V(τ) (Research 250 / Plan 283)
//! 3. `lambda_flow × (1-stop_prob)`     — cost penalty shape C(τ) = T (Plan 052)
//! 4. Entropy-band gate                 — paper §C.2 "effective entropy regime"
//! 5. Argmax over N scored trajectories — aggregation (Plan 260 shape)
//!
//! # GOAT Gate (Issue 030)
//!
//! | Gate | Criterion | Target |
//! |------|-----------|--------|
//! | G1 | Composite scorer accuracy vs single-component baselines | composite > best single by ≥3pp |
//! | G1b | Wasted-thought reduction (thoughts discarded vs all-run) | ≥30% discarded at matched accuracy |
//! | G2 | Effective entropy band — accuracy peaks inside [Ξ_low, Ξ_high] | interior maximum exists |
//! | G3 | Per-trajectory scoring latency | < 1µs at d_belief=32, vocab=8 |
//!
//! Promotion (per Issue 030): G1 + G1b + G2 + G3 all pass → promote to plan +
//! feature flag. Otherwise close.
//!
//! # Method
//!
//! Synthetic task: 8-action choice. Each query has a known correct action.
//! Each "latent thought trajectory" = K iterations of `LatentThoughtKernel`
//! from a query-specific initial belief state. Pre-thought logits = projection
//! of initial state; post-thought logits = projection of post-K state. The
//! self-advantage of the correct action is the teacher-free quality signal V(τ).
//!
