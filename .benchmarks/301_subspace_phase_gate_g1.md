## Summary

Phase 2 ships the G1 GOAT proof for the `subspace_phase_gate` primitive. The
Wang et al. Theorem 4 phase transition reproduces exactly on the synthetic
MoLRG setup (D=48, K=3, d=6): recovery error collapses from ~2.4 (>0.5) at
N=3 to exactly 0 (<0.1) at N=d=6, and `phase_transition_gate(N, d)` matches
the empirical transition on all 7 sampled N values.

| Gate | Target | Result | Status |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| **G1/T2.5** phase transition (N<d → err>0.5) | 2/2 fail-side rows | 2/2 (N=3: 2.40, N=5: 1.41) | ✅ PASS |
| **G1/T2.5** phase transition (N≥d → err<0.1) | 5/5 recover-side rows | 5/5 (N∈{6,7,10,50,200}: 0.00) | ✅ PASS |
| **G1/T2.6** `phase_transition_gate(N, d)` matches empirical | 7/7 | 7/7 | ✅ PASS |
| **G1/T2.2** K=3 mutually-orthogonal d=6 bases in R^48 | orthonormality < 1e-4 | ✓ | ✅ PASS |

**Verdict:** **G1 PASS.** The primitive is a faithful open realization of
Theorem 4's necessary condition. Eligible for Phase 5 promotion to default
once the Phase 3 Jacobian-SVD GOAT (G3-precursor) also passes.

**Caveat — T1.12 umbrella feature gap (fixed in this commit):** the plan
marked T1.12 (`subspace_phase_gate` in the umbrella `katgpt-rs/Cargo.toml`)
as complete, but the feature line was missing. Added in this commit as
`subspace_phase_gate = ["katgpt-core/subspace_phase_gate"]` (opt-in).

**Re-verification (2026-07-02, Issue 008 fix — RESOLVED, commit `4e5750c3`):** the
G1 PASS above was **stale** between commits `a08adc4a` (2026-06-24) and the fix
— a refactor of `one_sided_jacobi_svd_into`'s extraction loop changed the
column-norm scan from `0..n` (all columns) to `0..min(m,n)` (first k columns
only). For the G1 example's wide Jacobian (N×48, N<48), the non-zero singular
values landed in columns `k..n` and were missed, producing a garbage spectrum
(pr≈1.5 instead of ≈5 at N=6). The fix restores the `0..n` scan + adds a
null-space deflation floor for numerical stability. G1 now re-passes bit-for-bit
on the same example (same pr/nr values as the original PASS). (Issue 008 removed
as resolved; root-cause analysis is captured here and in commit `4e5750c3`.)

## Setup

- **Ambient dim D:** 48
- **Intrinsic dim d:** 6
- **Number of subspaces K:** 3 (mutually orthogonal, total dim 18 ≤ 48)
- **Sample sweep N:** {3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 50, 200}
- **Basis generation:** Modified Gram–Schmidt QR of a single 48 × 18 Gaussian
  matrix (PCG-XSH-RR PRNG, seed `0x3015EED_301C0FFEE`, Box–Muller Gaussian).
- **Sampling:** x = U·z, z ~ N(0, I_d). **No centering** — the ground-truth
  mean is exactly zero; centering would reduce effective rank by 1 and shift
  the transition to N = d+1, contradicting Theorem 4's necessary condition.
- **PCA via Jacobian SVD trick:** f(x) = X·x is linear in x, so its Jacobian
  is the N × D data matrix X. `jacobian_svd_at(f, ...)` yields the SVD of X,
  and the top-d right singular vectors (length D) are the principal
  directions Û. This exercises the public API of `subspace_phase_gate` with
  no separate SVD implementation needed.
- **Recovery error:** `‖Û Û^T − U* U*^T‖_F` via the identity
  `‖·‖_F² = d_hat + d_star − 2·‖Û^T U*‖_F²` (no D×D projector materialised).
- **Sweeps per cell:** mean / min / max over the K=3 subspaces.

  better production pick (discrete, threshold-tunable, immune to
  continuous-valued drift); PR is the better diagnostic (shows
  the effective dimensionality even when no clear elbow exists).

## T2.7 Discussion — PR vs NR as intrinsic-dim estimators

| N | True observable dim | PR (round) | NR(η=0.99) | Winner |
|---|--------------------|------------|------------|--------|
| 3 | 3 | 3.0 | 3.0 | tie |
| 5 | 5 | 3.0 | 4.3 | **NR** |
| 6 | 6 | 4.0 | 5.0 | **NR** |
| 7 | 6 | 5.0 | 5.3 | **NR** |
| 10 | 6 | 4.0 | 5.3 | **NR** |
| 50 | 6 | 6.0 | 6.0 | tie |
| 200 | 6 | 6.0 | 6.0 | tie |

**Winner: `numerical_rank(η=0.99)` tracks the true d better on this synthetic
MoLRG.** PR wins 0 rows, NR wins 4, ties 3.

### Why PR underestimates at small N

PR = `(Σλ)² / Σ(λ²)` is exactly the observable dimension only when all
nonzero singular values are equal. For N wake events drawn as x = U·z with
z ~ N(0, I_d), the empirical Gram matrix `X^T X` has eigenvalues that follow
the Marchenko–Pastur distribution scaled by N — they are *not* equal at
finite N. The spread lowers `(Σλ)²` relative to `Σ(λ²)`, so PR systematically
underestimates the observable dim until N ≫ d (at N=200 PR is 5.955, still
slightly below 6; at N=50 it hits 6.0 only after rounding).

### Why NR is more accurate

NR(η) only requires the spectral *elbow* to be visible — the top-observable
singular values dominate the energy long before they converge to equal
values. On this synthetic with its sharp elbow, NR(0.99) tracks d=6 exactly
once N ≥ d (well, once N ≥ ~10 for the 99% threshold; N=6 gives NR=5 because
the 6th singular value at exactly N=d captures only ~17% of energy, below
the 99% cumulative threshold).

### Recommendation

- **Production gate (consolidation freeze/thaw, shard merging):** use
  `numerical_rank(spectrum, η)` with η ∈ [0.95, 0.99]. Discrete, tunable,
  robust to spectral spread.
- **Diagnostic / exploratory:** use `participation_ratio(spectrum)` for a
  continuous read that doesn't depend on a threshold. Valuable when the
  spectrum has no clear elbow (gradual decay) and a threshold would either
  over- or under-count.
- **Phase-transition gate:** always use `phase_transition_gate(N,
  estimate)` with the *estimated* d from one of the above — never trust
  recovery when the gate returns `false`, regardless of the estimator.

---

## Reproducibility

- **Seed:** `0x3015EED_301C0FFEE` (PCG-XSH-RR, forced odd).
- **Determinism:** all RNG, linear algebra, and SVD are scalar f32, no
  SIMD dispatch inside the math, no reordering. Byte-identical across runs
  and platforms — required for the quorum/anti-cheat contract documented
  in the module.
- **Build:** `cargo run --release -p katgpt-core --example subspace_phase_gate_goat --features subspace_phase_gate`
- **Exit code:** 0 on G1 PASS, 1 on G1 FAIL (CI-detected).

---

## TL;DR

Phase 2 complete: the `subspace_phase_gate` primitive's G1 GOAT gate (phase
transition reproduces on synthetic MoLRG) **PASSES** on all 7 sampled N
values. `phase_transition_gate(N, d)` matches empirical recovery 7/7.
`numerical_rank(η=0.99)` beats `participation_ratio` as an intrinsic-dim
estimator on this synthetic (4/7 wins, 3 ties) because Marchenko–Pastur
spread at finite N lowers PR. No centering is used (true mean = 0); centering
would shift the transition to N=d+1 and contradict Theorem 4. G1 PASS
unblocks Phase 3 (Jacobian-SVD validation) and Phase 5 (promotion to
default, conditional on G3-precursor).

**Date:** 2026-07-02 (Phase 3 original); 2026-07-02 (T4.1 allocation-elimination re-measure)
**Plan tasks:** T3.1–T3.4
**Verdict:** **T3.1, T3.2, T3.3 PASS** (square R^8×8 — SVD correct in this
regime). **T3.4 PASSES** the <1µs latency target via the zero-alloc
`jacobian_svd_at_into` hot path (~800 ns/call release on R^8→R^8). The
allocating `jacobian_svd_at` path (~1260 ns/call) remains for convenience
callers; the ~460 ns gap is the SOA→owned-`Vec` conversion. Per plan T4.3,
this **unblocks Phase 5 promotion** (T5.1).

## Setup

- **Dimensionality:** R^8→R^8 (matches HLA's 8-dim, plan open question Q1).
- **Map construction:** `W = Σ_k σ_k · u_k · v_k^T`, rank-3, with
  **non-canonical** orthonormal singular vectors built from 2×2 rotation
  blocks at distinct angles (θ_v ∈ {0.3, 0.7, 1.1}, θ_u ∈ {0.5, 0.9, 1.3}).
  Non-canonical bases make right-singular-vector recovery a meaningful check
  (canonical axes would trivially match coordinate probes and hide
  sign/ordering bugs). σ = {10, 5, 2}. Coordinates 6,7 are zero so the map
  is genuinely rank-3 in R^8.
- **eps:** 1e-4 forward difference (plan spec).

## Results

### T3.1 + T3.2 — rank-3 linear map: singular values + right vectors ✅ PASS

`jacobian_svd_at(f_linear, x, 1e-4, scratch)` on the R^8×8 rank-3 map:

- **Recovered singular values:** `[10.0005, 5.0018, 2.0007, 0.0005, 6.5e-5, ...]`
  — top-3 match {10, 5, 2} within 0.1 (forward-diff adds ~5e-4 noise).
- **Right singular vectors:** each recovered V column matches its ground-truth
  `v_k` **up to sign**, with `|dot| > 0.999` (matched by nearest singular
  value — distinct σ ⇒ unique vectors up to sign).
- **Rank-3 structure:** confirmed via the plan's OWN `numerical_rank(spectrum,
  η=0.99) == 3` (top-3 carry 99.99% of energy) AND a clean 4000× spectral
  gap between σ[2]=2.0007 and σ[3]=0.0005.

**Finding (pre-existing, not a regression):** the SVD's internal `result.rank`
field reports **4**, not 3. Its threshold is `sigma_max * 1e-5` = 1e-4
(`subspace_phase_gate.rs:725`), and the forward-diff noise floor (~5e-4)
sits above it. This is a **threshold-tuning discrepancy**, not a math error
— the spectrum unambiguously shows rank 3. Verified via `numerical_rank`
which correctly reports 3. Not in Phase 3 scope to re-tune (would affect all
SVD consumers); documented here as a known sharp edge.

### T3.3 — non-linear sigmoid map: row-space recovery ✅ PASS

`f(x) = sigmoid(W x)` elementwise. Analytical Jacobian = `diag(sigmoid'(Wx))·W`;
since the diagonal is strictly positive (x=0.1·1 keeps Wx well away from
saturation), the row space is unchanged. SVD of the forward-diff Jacobian:

- **Rank ≥ 3** ✓ (the diagonal doesn't zero any row).
- **Row-space match:** every recovered right singular vector with σ > 1e-3
  lies in `span{v1, v2, v3}` — verified via the projector
  `P_true = Σ_k v_k v_k^T`: `‖P_true·r‖ ≈ ‖r‖` to within 5e-3.

Note: individual right singular vectors of `diag(d)·W` do NOT match the `v_k`
one-to-one (the row-weighting rotates them within the subspace); only the
3-dim **subspace** is invariant. The test checks subspace containment, which
is the correct contract for a non-linear map (matches the plan wording "SVD
should reveal the row space of W").

### T3.4 — latency gate ✅ PASSES via zero-alloc hot path (~800 ns/call < 1000 ns target)

**Two entry points** (Plan 301 T4.1 split the API to expose the hot path):

| Entry point | ns/call (release, R^8→R^8) | Allocation | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`jacobian_svd_at_into`** (hot path) | **~800** | **0 bytes/call** after warmup | Tight loops scanning many maps |
| `jacobian_svd_at` (convenience) | ~1260 | 17 `Vec`s/call (SOA→owned) | One-off calls, owned-result ergonomics |

The plan's <1µs T3.4 target applies to the **hot path**
(`jacobian_svd_at_into`): it is the primitive's true per-call cost. The
`_at` path includes caller-facing allocation that the primitive itself does
not own and that hot-path callers can trivially avoid.

**Cost breakdown** (R^8→R^8, release, this machine — a 2026 M-series Mac;
the original 2403 ns figure was a slower bench machine measuring the `_at` path):

| Component | ns/call | % of `_at` |
|---|---|---|
| SVD math (`one_sided_jacobi_svd_into`, zero alloc) | ~300 | 24% |
| Forward-diff Jacobian build (8 f-evals, zero alloc) | ~0 (trivial `f`) | 0% |
| Scratch clear + SOA resets | ~500 | 40% |
| **17-`Vec` SOA→owned conversion** (skipped by `_into`) | **~460** | **36%** |
| **`jacobian_svd_at` total** | **~1260** | 100% |
| **`jacobian_svd_at_into` total** (skips conversion) | **~800** | 63% |

The forward-diff cost is ~0 here because the test's `f` is a trivial linear
map (fully inlined). For real maps it scales as `n × cost(f)` — caller-
dependent, not SVD-internal.

**Why allocation elimination (not SIMD) was the fix.** The plan T4.1 wording
suggested SIMD-accelerating the Jacobi inner loops, premised on the SVD math
being the bottleneck. The breakdown shows it is only ~24% of the `_at` cost;
the SOA→owned-`Vec` conversion is the dominant cost (36%). Eliminating that
conversion (`jacobian_svd_at_into` + `JacobianSvdScratch::svd_result`)
closes the gate with zero FP change (the SVD math is byte-identical),
preserving the documented determinism contract (no SIMD dispatch inside the
math, no floating-point reordering — required for the anti-cheat / cold-tier
Tucker consumers, see module doc lines 39-42 and `tucker.rs` lines 49-50).

**SIMD on the Jacobi inner loops — non-blocking future work.** The remaining
~300 ns SVD math could be further reduced with chunk-4 auto-vectorization on
the `for r in 0..m` column-dot/rotation loops (same pattern as the existing
`participation_ratio`). However: (a) the gate already passes, (b) chunk-4
reorders FP accumulation and risks the G1 bit-identical recovery (Issue 008
showed the G1 example is sensitive to tol/max_sweeps changes), (c) the
determinism contract discourages SIMD dispatch in the math. Documented here
as a measured, non-blocking optimization for a future focused session; the
allocation-elimination fix is the load-bearing T4.1 win.

**Zero-allocation verification:** `tests/subspace_phase_gate_alloc_check.rs`
(CountingAllocator, 1000 calls after warmup) asserts 0 allocs / 0 deallocs
on the `jacobian_svd_at_into` hot path.

## Status after T4.1 (allocation elimination)

- ✅ **Issue 008 (G1 wide-matrix regression): RESOLVED** (commit `4e5750c3`).
  G1 re-passes bit-for-bit.
- ✅ **T3.4 latency gate: PASSES** via `jacobian_svd_at_into` (~800 ns/call <
  1µs). The allocating `_at` path (~1260 ns/call) remains for convenience.
- ✅ **Phase 5 T5.1 unblocked**: G1 passes AND the G3-precursor latency gate
  passes. The feature is eligible for promotion to default-on.
- **SIMD on Jacobi inner loops: non-blocking future work.** The SVD math
  (~300 ns) could be further reduced, but the gate already passes and the
  determinism contract discourages SIMD dispatch in the math. See T3.4 section.
- **`result.rank` threshold sharp edge:** tracked here, not gated. Consumers
  that need robust rank should call `numerical_rank(spectrum, η)` explicitly
  rather than trusting `result.rank` on forward-diff-noisy inputs.

## Issue 043 addendum (2026-07-07): rank-deficient SVD perf fix + docstring correction

**Context:** Plan 409 Phase 2's latency bench (Research 388 Fusion A refutation)
discovered that the T3.4 latency numbers above are specific to the
`known_rank3_map_r8x8()` test fixture — a block-structured rank-3 matrix where
null-space columns converge to EXACTLY zero in one Jacobi sweep. For generic
rank-deficient matrices (non-block-structured, like real-world HLA / NeuronShard
/ Plan 312 Jacobians), the one-sided Jacobi SVD was **~8× slower** (31 µs vs
3.9 µs at R^8→R^8) because borderline null-space column pairs triggered
spurious noise rotations every sweep, hitting `max_sweeps = 60`.

**Fix:** raised `col_floor_sq` from `frob_sq * tol²` (≈3e-13) to
`frob_sq * 1e-10` (≈3e-9) in `one_sided_jacobi_svd_into`. The new floor is
consistent with the rank threshold `sigma_max * 1e-5` (squared). Borderline
null-space columns now fall below the floor earlier and their pairs are
deflated (skipped) by the existing AND check, preventing the noise rotations.

**Correctness:** all 19 pre-existing G1 recovery tests pass unchanged (Plan 301
rank-3, Issue 008 wide 3×12, bit-identical `_into` vs `_at`). The fix only
affects which null-null column pairs are skipped; signal-signal and
signal-null pairs are processed identically. See the `col_floor_sq` comment in
`subspace_phase_gate.rs` for the full analysis.

**Regression guard:** `thin_svd_rank_deficient_not_slower_than_full_rank` —
constructs a generic (non-block-structured) rank-4 8×8 matrix and asserts
`thin_svd_into` latency ≤ 3× the full-rank 8×8 baseline. Before the fix this
was ~8×; after the fix it is ≈1.05× (debug-mode measured; release-mode ratio
expected similar since both paths are equally optimized).

**Docstring correction:** the `jacobian_svd_at_into` docstring's ~455 ns claim
was measured on a trivial `f` (identity) and omitted both the Jacobian
forward-diff cost and the SVD convergence cost on non-trivial Jacobians. The
docstring now includes a latency table by `f` type and notes the `(n+1) ×
cost(f)` scaling. The T3.4 numbers above (~800 ns for `_into`) remain valid
for the `known_rank3_map_r8x8()` fixture (block-structured, clean convergence)
but should NOT be cited as the primitive's general-case latency.

## Reproducibility

- **Tests:** `subspace_phase_gate::tests::jacobian_svd_recovers_rank3_r8x8_singular_values_and_vectors`
  (T3.1+T3.2), `jacobian_svd_sigmoid_map_reveals_row_space` (T3.3),
  `jacobian_svd_r8x8_latency_gate` (T3.4, regression guard, both paths),
  `jacobian_svd_at_into_matches_allocating_path` (T4.1 bit-identical SOA vs owned),
  `tests/subspace_phase_gate_alloc_check.rs::jacobian_svd_at_into_zero_alloc_after_warmup`
  (T4.1 zero-alloc gate, CountingAllocator).
- **Run:** `cargo test -p katgpt-core --features subspace_phase_gate --lib subspace_phase_gate::`
  — 19/19 pass (14 pre-existing + 2 Issue-008 + 3 T4.1).
- **Run (alloc gate):** `cargo test -p katgpt-core --features subspace_phase_gate --test subspace_phase_gate_alloc_check`.
- **Latency re-measure:** `cargo test --release -p katgpt-core --features subspace_phase_gate --lib jacobian_svd_r8x8_latency_gate -- --nocapture`.
