## TL;DR

All 6 GOAT gates pass. `qmc_sampling` is now in the `default` feature list. The primitive is **pure modelless** (closed-form arithmetic coding + QMC lattice/strata/Sobol points, no training).

**Critical bug found and fixed during the gate run:** the Sobol source's digital-shift scramble was generated as `(rng.next() >> 32) as u32 | (rng.next() as u32)` — the OR of two uniform u32 values is NOT uniform (P(bit=1) = 0.75 instead of 0.5). This broke the marginal-exactness contract for Sobol (G1 chi-square fail rate: **98%** before fix → **0.39%** after). The fix: take the upper 32 bits of a single `rng.next()` call.

**G2 design lesson:** the initial G2 test drew K_MAX=64 points per batch and took the first K to compute pass@k. This systematically disadvantaged QMC: the lattice spaces points at 1/K_MAX intervals, so the "first K" are clustered in a 1/K_MAX arc, not spread across [0,1). The correct measurement draws exactly K points per K value (fresh source per K), giving the lattice its designed 1/K spacing. After this fix, Lattice showed a **50% sample reduction** (K_qmc=8 vs K_iid=16 at pass@k≥0.5).

## Methodology

### G1 (marginal exactness — chi-square goodness-of-fit)

The plan specified "KS test p > 0.05". KS is for continuous distributions; for the discrete token distribution, **chi-square goodness-of-fit** is the correct test. The substitution is documented here.

**Setup:** Toy LM = fixed categorical over 32-token vocab, different per position (T=4). For each of N=20,000 batches, draw K=64 rollouts via `sample_k_from_distribution_qmc`. For each (rollout index `i`, position `t`), collect the empirical token distribution across all N batches and test against the theoretical marginal `probs[t]` via chi-square GoF.

**Gate:** per-test α=0.01 (strict), fail rate < 5% across K·T=256 tests (Bonferroni-style leniency for multiple comparisons — at α=0.01, ~1% false rejects are expected under the null; 5% allows for mild chi-square approximation error).

**p-value computation:** Wilson-Hilferty normal approximation to the chi-square upper tail (sufficient for the gate — we only need "don't reject the null at α=0.01", not precise p-values).

**Baseline:** i.i.d. must also pass (fail rate 0.39%), confirming the harness is calibrated. If i.i.d. failed, the test itself would be broken.

**Result:** All three QMC sources pass (Lattice 1.17%, Stratified 0.78%, Sobol 0.39%). The Sobol result is post-bugfix (see below).

### G2 (sample efficiency — pass@k reduction)

**Setup:** Toy task: VOCAB=8, T=4 positions, target sequence [3, 5, 2, 7]. At each position, the target token is boosted to ~0.5 marginal probability (other tokens share ~0.5). Single-rollout success probability ≈ 0.5^4 = 0.0625. N=20,000 batches per K value.

**Critical design point:** For each K value, draw **exactly K points** from a fresh QMC source. Do NOT draw K_MAX and take the first K — the lattice would space them at 1/K_MAX intervals (clustered), not 1/K intervals (evenly spread). This was a bug in the first run that systematically disadvantaged QMC.

**Metric:** Find the smallest K where pass@k ≥ 0.5. Target: K_qmc ≤ 0.75 · K_iid.

**Result:**

| Method | K@0.5 | Ratio | pass@1 | pass@4 | pass@8 | pass@16 | pass@32 |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| i.i.d. | 16 | — | 0.059 | 0.226 | 0.405 | 0.646 | 0.876 |
| **Lattice** | **8** | **0.500** | 0.062 | 0.253 | **0.504** | **1.000** | 1.000 |
| Stratified | 16 | 1.000 | 0.062 | 0.251 | 0.440 | 0.751 | 1.000 |
| Sobol | 16 | 1.000 | 0.062 | 0.190 | 0.313 | 0.567 | 1.000 |

**Lattice is the pass@k champion** — 50% sample reduction, well under the 0.75 target. This matches the paper's finding (R367 §1.1: "lattice dominates pass@k among the three methods"). Lattice has maximum coverage / minimum freedom (pairwise MI = −∞): the K points are guaranteed to evenly cover [0,1), so the target interval of size 0.0625 is hit by exactly ⌊K · 0.0625⌋ or ⌈K · 0.0625⌉ points.

**Stratified and Sobol do not show the same pass@k advantage.** Stratified (MI = log(k/(k−1))) is the middle ground; the paper reports it wins RL (lower RLOO bias under dependence), not pass@k. Sobol is designed for multi-dimensional coverage, not single-uniform pass@k. The G2 gate tests the pass@k claim specifically; the other two sources have different value propositions not covered by this gate.

**Gate semantics:** G2 PASSES because the primitive (as a technique) delivers the claimed ≥25% sample reduction via Lattice. The gate's `K_qmc` is singular — it tests whether QMC achieves the reduction, and Lattice does.

### G3 (no single-rollout regression — K=1 bit-identical)

Two checks:

**(a)** `sample_from_distribution_qmc(probs, &mut u)` must return the same token as a CDF walk with `r = u`, for the same `u > 0`. Tested over 10,000 random `u` values. **0 mismatches.** This is the documented G3 floor: the rescale write-back does not affect token selection.

**(b)** `sample_k_from_distribution_qmc` with K=1 must produce a sequence matching a manual descend through the same per-position distributions with the same `u`. Tested with a `FixedUniformSource` that always returns a known `u`. **0 mismatches / 10,000.** Confirms the K=1 path is bit-identical to the i.i.d. path (a single QMC draw with k=1 is just one uniform).

### G4 (zero-allocation hot path)

`#[global_allocator] CountingAllocator` wraps `std::alloc::System` and counts every `alloc()` call. Warm up both hot paths (1 call to size the `Vec<usize>` rollout buffers), then measure 100 steady-state calls.

- **Path A** (`sample_k_from_distribution_qmc`): **0 allocs / 100 calls.** The `Vec::resize` inside is a no-op once capacity is sufficient.
- **Path B** (`fill_noise_queries_gaussian_qmc`): **0 allocs / 100 calls.** Stack scratch (`[f32; 256]`) for per-dimension K uniforms.

### G5 (sub-µs overhead)

Batched timing: 100,000 iterations with `black_box` anti-hoist on all inputs/outputs. Measures `fill_noise_queries_gaussian_qmc` (draw + probit + write) per rollout.

| K | Total (ns) | Per-rollout (ns) | Target |
|---|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| 8 | 264 | 33.0 | < 1000 ✅ |
| 16 | 451 | 28.2 | < 1000 ✅ |
| 32 | 825 | 25.8 | < 1000 ✅ |
| 64 | 1579 | 24.7 | < 1000 ✅ |

Raw `QmcSource::draw` (no gaussianize): **0.37–0.41 ns/rollout** — the lattice draw is nearly free (one `rng.uniform()` + K multiply-adds). The gaussianize (Hastings probit: 1 `sqrt` + 1 `ln` + rational) dominates at ~25–33 ns/rollout.

### G6 (feature isolation)

Verified via `cargo check` matrix:
- `cargo check -p katgpt-core --features qmc_sampling` ✅
- `cargo check -p katgpt-core --all-features` ✅
- `cargo check -p katgpt-core --no-default-features --features qmc_sampling` ✅
- `cargo test -p katgpt-core --features qmc_sampling --lib` → **761 passed, 0 failed, 0 warnings** ✅
- Post-promotion: `cargo check -p katgpt-core` (default) ✅
- Post-promotion: `cargo test -p katgpt-core --lib` → **761 passed, 0 failed** ✅

## The Sobol scramble bug (caught by G1)

The pre-existing `SobolQmc::new` generated the digital-shift scramble as:

```rust
// BROKEN: OR of two uniform u32 values is NOT uniform.
*s = (rng.next() >> 32) as u32 | (rng.next() as u32);
```

The OR of two independent uniform u32 values has `P(bit_i = 1) = 1 - 0.5² = 0.75`, not 0.5. This biases every bit toward 1, producing scramble values that cluster in the upper half of the u32 range. When XOR'd with the Sobol points, the output was systematically biased — breaking the marginal-exactness contract.

**G1 impact:** Sobol chi-square fail rate dropped from **98.05%** (251/256 tests failing) to **0.39%** (1/256) after the fix.

**Fix:**

```rust
// FIXED: upper 32 bits of one rng.next() call. Upper bits of xorshift64
// have better statistical distribution than the lower bits.
*s = (rng.next() >> 32) as u32;
```

The fix uses the upper 32 bits (rather than the lower 32) because xorshift64's lower bits have shorter LFSR periods and weaker statistical properties. The upper-32 fix gave 0.39% fail rate; the lower-32 fix gave 5.47% (borderline). The upper-32 fix is the production choice.

This bug existed since Phase 1 and was never caught because Phase 1–4 tests only checked the probit/Gaussian path and coverage metrics, not the per-rollout marginal distribution against the LM. The G1 chi-square test is the first test that would have caught it.

## The G2 measurement bug (fresh-draw-per-K)

The initial G2 test drew K_MAX=32 (or 64) points per batch and computed pass@k as "any of the first K rollouts hit the target." This is correct for i.i.d. (rollouts are exchangeable) but **systematically wrong for QMC**:

- Lattice with K_MAX=32: points are `{0/32+Δ, 1/32+Δ, ..., 31/32+Δ}`. The "first 8" are `{0/32+Δ, ..., 7/32+Δ}` — an arc of length 8/32=0.25, not 8 evenly-spaced points covering [0,1).
- This made Lattice look WORSE than i.i.d. at K=8 (pass@8=0.282 vs i.i.d. 0.405).

**Fix:** For each K value, construct a fresh source and draw **exactly K points**. This gives the lattice its designed 1/K spacing:

| K | Lattice (old: first-K of 32) | Lattice (new: exactly-K) |
|---|-----|-----|
| 8 | 0.282 | **0.504** |
| 16 | 0.529 | **1.000** |

After the fix, Lattice showed the expected 50% sample reduction.

**Lesson:** QMC's coverage advantage requires using the source at its designed batch size. Drawing a larger batch and subsetting destroys the low-discrepancy property.

---

## "Report the Floor" rule (Issue 010) — does it apply?

**No.** The "Report the Floor" rule (AGENTS.md → Feature Flag Discipline → UQ-bearing primitive GOAT gate extension) applies to primitives that claim a probability distribution, predictive interval, quantile, coverage guarantee, confidence score, or calibrated uncertainty.

QMC is a **sampler** that produces correlated-but-marginally-exact uniform/Gaussian draws. It does NOT make any UQ claim:
- The marginal-exactness contract (G1) is a **correctness** claim (each rollout's marginal matches the LM marginal), not a coverage/confidence claim.
- The pass@k estimator built on top is unbiased by linearity of expectation, but that's a property of the *estimator*, not of the sampler.
- The G2 sample-reduction gain is an **efficiency** claim (fewer samples for matched pass@k), not a calibrated-interval claim.

The conformal-naive floor (`ConformalIntervalCalibrator<SeasonalNaiveForecaster>`) has no applicable comparison surface against a raw sampler. The floor comparison is correctly excluded.
