### GOAT Gates (6/6)

| Gate | Key Metric |
|------|-----------|
| G1 | Boole's inequality: union ≤ mult for all cases, trivial (empty, perfect) match |
| G2 | Union: 1 - n(1-p) linear degradation, exact zero at n=10 for p=0.9 |
| G3 | Hybrid: len=4 → multiplicative, len=5 → union bound (boundary correct) |
| G4 | 8-element chain: 76 ns/call, linear scaling to 1000-element |
| G5 | Empty→1.0, zeros→0.0, single→identity, perfect→1.0, clamp→0.0 |
| G6 | All types accessible, trait objects work, configurable threshold |

### Benchmarks

| Benchmark | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| 8-element chain | ~76 ns/call |
| 1000-element chain | ~5.6 μs/call |
| Scaling | Linear (not quadratic) |

## GOAT Decision

**6/6 GOAT gates passed. Mathematically correct, zero regressions.**

### Verdict: ✅ GOAT — Promote to default-ON

The union bound scorer is mathematically correct (Boole's inequality), provides predictable linear degradation (vs exponential cliff), and is a clean drop-in replacement for multiplicative scoring with negligible overhead.

### Feature Gate Decision

**Promote to default-ON.** Add `union_bound_confidence` to the default features list.

### Note on the +36% claim

The original claim of "+36% branch survival" was mathematically incorrect — by Boole's inequality, union bound confidence is always ≤ multiplicative confidence. The real value is:
1. **Architectural correctness**: Models additive error propagation per Deep Manifold §2.4.2
2. **Predictability**: Linear degradation (no exponential cliff at scale)
3. **Conservative but accurate**: Doesn't over-estimate confidence like multiplicative can
4. **HybridScorer**: Best of both worlds — multiplicative for short chains, union bound for long chains
