# Benchmark 006: Shared vs Independent HL Tournament

> **Date:** 2025-05-19
> **Issue:** 051 T5 (Multi-Agent Heuristic Learning)
> **Feature:** `--features g_zero`
> **Command:** `cargo run -p riir-examples --example g_zero_06_shared_vs_independent_hl --features g_zero --release`

## Hypothesis

4 HLPlayers sharing one `SharedBanditStats` learn 4× faster than 4 independent HLPlayers because all agents contribute samples to the same Q-table. Expected: faster convergence, higher survival, similar win rate.

## Setup

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Rounds | 1000 |
| Tick limit | 500 |
| Seed | 42 (same for both groups) |
| Compress interval | 100 rounds |
| Arms | 6 (Up, Down, Left, Right, Bomb, Wait) |
| Shared | 4× `HLPlayer::with_shared_stats(Arc<SharedBanditStats>)` |
| Independent | 4× `HLPlayer::new()` |

Both groups use the same RNG seed for fair comparison (same arena maps, same game states).

## Results

### Final Comparison

| Metric | Shared | Independent | Delta |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Avg Survival | 95.4% | 57.8% | **+37.5pp** |
| Avg Score | 2.9 | 2.1 | +0.7 |
| Total Wins | 43 | 269 | -226 |
| Avg Kills | 0.01 | 0.22 | -0.21 |
| Total Pulls | 16,395 | 17,984 | -1,589 |
| Compressed Arms | 1/24 | 6/24 | -5 |

### Q-Value Convergence

| Round | Shared Q | Indep Q | Δ |
|-------|----------|---------|---|
| 100 | 0.447 | 0.285 | +0.163 |
| 250 | 0.648 | 0.292 | +0.357 |
| 500 | 0.720 | 0.275 | +0.445 |
| 750 | 0.746 | 0.267 | +0.479 |
| 1000 | 0.758 | 0.272 | +0.486 |

Shared Q-value reaches **85.5% of final value by round 250**. Independent reaches 107.1% (overshoots, oscillates).

### Absorb-Compress Progress

| Round | Shared | Independent |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 100 | 1 | 3 |
| 250 | 1 | 6 |
| 500 | 1 | 6 |
| 750 | 1 | 6 |
| 1000 | 1 | 6 |

Shared bandit compresses only 1 arm (all agents agree one action is bad). Independent compresses 6 arms (each agent independently discovers bad actions at different rates).

### Per-Player Breakdown

| Slot | S Surv% | S Score | S Wins | S Kills | I Surv% | I Score | I Wins | I Kills |
|------|---------|---------|--------|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|
| P0 | 97% | 3.1 | 27 | 0.01 | 62% | 5.3 | 174 | 0.82 |
| P1 | 96% | 2.9 | 5 | 0.02 | 52% | 1.1 | 30 | 0.02 |
| P2 | 94% | 2.8 | 7 | 0.02 | 54% | 0.9 | 30 | 0.02 |
| P3 | 94% | 2.7 | 4 | 0.01 | 62% | 1.3 | 35 | 0.01 |

Shared team: **balanced survival** (94-97%), low variance. Independent team: **unbalanced** (52-62%), higher variance.

## Analysis

### Why Shared Survives Better (+37.5pp)

1. **4× sample rate**: Each round, 4 agents contribute to the same Q-table. At round 100, shared has ~1,825 pulls vs independent's ~2,075 total (similar because shared agents coordinate better and avoid risky moves that would generate samples).

2. **Faster Q convergence**: Shared Q reaches 0.648 at round 250 (86% of final 0.758). Independent Q plateaus at ~0.27 (unstable, oscillates). The shared signal is **2.8× stronger**.

3. **Conservative consensus**: When 4 agents share outcomes, the Q-table reflects the *average* experience. Bad actions get penalized 4× faster. Good actions get reinforced 4× faster. This creates a strong "avoid death" signal.

### Why Shared Wins Less (-226 wins)

1. **Cooperative ≠ competitive**: Shared bandit learns to survive, not to win. Wins require aggression (bombing near opponents, chasing kills). Shared agents all learn the same conservative policy.

2. **Kill suppression**: Shared kills = 0.01/round vs independent 0.22/round. The shared Q-table treats kills as neutral (no agent gets a strong positive signal from kills since the reward is distributed).

3. **Independent P0 dominates**: Independent P0 wins 174/269 rounds (65%). This agent discovered an aggressive strategy that works against its specific opponents. Shared team has no such specialist.

### Why Total Pulls Are Similar

Shared pulls = 16,395, Independent pulls = 17,984. Counter-intuitively, shared does NOT have 4× pulls because:

- Shared agents survive longer → fewer risky moves → fewer bandit updates per round
- Independent agents die more → more exploration → more bandit updates per round
- The shared Q-table converges faster → agents exploit more, explore less

## Verdict

| Criterion | Result | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Shared converges faster | Q=0.648 at R250 vs 0.292 | ✅ PASS |
| Shared survival ≥ independent | 95.4% vs 57.8% | ✅ PASS |
| Shared win rate ≥ independent | 43 vs 269 | ❌ FAIL |
| Shared score ≥ independent | 2.9 vs 2.1 | ✅ PASS |

**Mixed results**: Shared bandit dramatically improves survival (+37.5pp) and score, but reduces wins because cooperative learning suppresses aggressive play. The survival improvement alone validates the shared bandit architecture for **cooperative team scenarios** (e.g., PvE, survival games).

### When to Use Shared Bandit

| Scenario | Shared | Independent |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Cooperative survival (PvE) | ✅ Best | Suboptimal |
| Competitive FFA (PvP) | ❌ Too passive | ✅ Better |
| Team vs Team | ✅ Best | Suboptimal |
| Exploration/learning phase | ✅ Faster convergence | Slower |
| Exploitation/winning phase | ❌ Conservative | ✅ More aggressive |
