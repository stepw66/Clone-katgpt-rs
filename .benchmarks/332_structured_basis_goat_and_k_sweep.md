# Plan 332 — Structured Basis Selection for FUNCATTN: GOAT Gate Results

**Date:** 2026-06-26
**Plan:** [332_structured_basis_selection_for_funcattn.md](../.plans/332_structured_basis_selection_for_funcattn.md)
**Feature:** `funcattn_structured_basis` (opt-in, NOT promoted to default)
**Verdict:** **MIXED — partial PASS (Haar-packet at k≤8, τ=0.5; DCT-log on frequency-aligned signals). Strict G1+G2 gate FAILS on the probe signal; not promoted. Cross-checked against FUNCATTN paper Table 7 — fixed spectral bases are competitive on real PDE data, so the probe-signal DCT-log failure is a frequency-mismatch artifact, not a constructor bug.**

---

## TL;DR

The Phase 0 probe (Issue 001) showed a HAND-CRAFTED signal-aligned basis beats random-orthogonal by +0.11 cos on multi-scale transport. Plan 332 asked: can a PRINCIPLED fixed basis (no a-priori signal knowledge) capture ≥50% of that gain?

**Answer: depends on whether the fixed basis's frequency grid aligns with the signal.**

- **Haar-packet** captures **77.4%** of the achievable gain at k=8, τ=0.5 on the probe signal. Wins at k∈{4,8}, loses at k≥16.
- **DCT-log on the probe signal**: actively hurts (−0.1427). **BUT** on a DCT-aligned signal (integer frequencies matching the DCT grid), DCT-log beats random by **+0.3449** — confirming the constructor is correct and the probe-signal failure was a frequency-mismatch artifact.
- **This is consistent with the FUNCATTN paper's own Table 7** (arXiv:2605.31559 §5.7): fixed Fourier basis + FuncAttn achieves 0.51 on Airfoil vs 0.43 for learned — fixed spectral bases are competitive (~19% worse), NOT actively harmful, on real PDE data with broad spectral content.
- The k-sweep confirms T3.3: principled wins at k∈{4,8}, elbow at k=16.
- Strict G1+G2 gate FAILS → feature stays opt-in. Haar is documented as the recommended default for small-k transport; DCT-log for spectral-aligned tasks.

## Test artifacts

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `crates/katgpt-core/src/funcattn.rs` | `make_dct_log_basis`, `make_haar_packet_basis`, `gram_schmidt_rows` (private helper) — all gated by `#[cfg(feature = "funcattn_structured_basis")]` |
| `crates/katgpt-core/src/funcattn.rs` (tests module) | 5 unit tests: orthonormality, frequency coverage, forward-pass sanity |
| `crates/katgpt-core/tests/funcattn_structured_basis_g1.rs` | Phase 2 GOAT gate (G1 + G2 verdict) |
| `crates/katgpt-core/tests/funcattn_structured_basis_k_sweep.rs` | Phase 3 k-sweep (k ∈ {4,8,16,32}) |

---

## Phase 2 — GOAT gate (d=64, n=20, k=8)

### τ = 0.5 (the default temperature)

| Basis | cos(out, target) | Δ vs random | G1 (≥+0.05) | G2 (≥50% of achievable) |
|-------|------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| random-orthogonal | +0.4806 | — (baseline) | — | — |
| hand-crafted (upper bound) | +0.5900 | +0.1093 | — | 100% (definition) |
| **DCT-log** | +0.3379 | **−0.1427** | ❌ KILL | −130.5% |
| **Haar-packet** | +0.5652 | **+0.0846** | ✅ PASS | **77.4% ✅ PASS** |

### τ = 0.1 (sharp sigmoid)

| Basis | cos(out, target) | Δ vs random | G1 | G2 |
|-------|------------------|-------------|----|----|
| random-orthogonal | +0.5526 | — | — | — |
| hand-crafted | +0.5772 | +0.0245 | — | 100% |
| DCT-log | +0.4180 | −0.1346 | ❌ KILL | −548.7% |
| Haar-packet | +0.4678 | −0.0848 | ❌ KILL | −345.8% |

**Observation:** at τ=0.1 the sigmoid is so sharp that Φ saturates and basis choice matters less — consistent with the Phase 0 probe finding. The gate is only meaningful at τ=0.5 (the default).

### Verdict

- **G1 (strict AND of both bases)**: **FAIL** — DCT-log fails at both τ; Haar fails at τ=0.1.
- **G2 (strict AND)**: **FAIL** — same reason.
- **Per-basis**: Haar-packet PASSES G1+G2 at τ=0.5 (the meaningful regime); DCT-log KILLS everywhere.

Per Plan 332 T4.3, the strict-gate failure means **document the negative result and do NOT promote to default**. The partial success (Haar at τ=0.5, k≤8) is recorded below as a documented option for callers.

## Phase 3 — k-sweep (d=64, n=20, τ=0.5)

```
   k      random     DCT-log   Haar-packet  hand-craft  Δ(DCT-rand)   Δ(Haar-r)
   4     +0.4192     +0.1228       +0.5065     +0.4837     -0.2965     +0.0873
   8     +0.4806     +0.3379       +0.5652     +0.5900     -0.1427     +0.0846
  16     +0.6370     +0.2066       +0.4548     +0.6066     -0.4305     -0.1822
  32     +0.6698     +0.1328       +0.3091     +0.4968     -0.5370     -0.3607
```

### Elbow analysis (T3.3)

- **k=4**: best principled (Haar) +0.5065, random +0.4192, **gap +0.0873** ✅
- **k=8**: best principled (Haar) +0.5652, random +0.4806, **gap +0.0846** ✅
- **k=16**: best principled (Haar) +0.4548, random +0.6370, **gap −0.1822** ❌ (elbow)
- **k=32**: best principled (Haar) +0.3091, random +0.6698, **gap −0.3607** ❌

**Hypothesis CONFIRMED**: principled bases help more at small k. k=4 gap = +0.0873, k=32 gap = −0.3607.

**Elbow at k=16**: above this, random-orthogonal catches up and overtakes principled. This matches the NPC regime boundary (k=4..16) flagged in Research 257 §5 item 5.

### Why DCT-log loses on the probe signal (frequency mismatch, NOT a constructor bug)

DCT-log picks smooth log-spaced sinusoids at integer frequencies 1, 2, 3, ..., 32 cycles across d=64. The probe signal's along-`j` frequencies are `0.1 · f_s · (s+1)` = [0.3, 2.0, 5.1, 9.6] cycles — NOT integers, and clustered at the low end. DCT-log's basis vectors at integer frequencies don't sparsely represent non-integer-frequency signals; the high-frequency DCT rows (12, 19, 32) pick up only noise.

**Verification (added after cross-checking against the FUNCATTN paper):** on a DCT-ALIGNED signal (integer frequencies 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 cycles matching the DCT grid), DCT-log beats random by **+0.3449 cos** (vs −0.1427 on the probe signal). The constructor is correct; the probe-signal failure is a frequency-mismatch artifact.

**Cross-reference: FUNCATTN paper Table 7** (arXiv:2605.31559 §5.7): fixed Fourier basis + FuncAttn achieves 0.51 on Airfoil vs 0.43 for learned. Fixed spectral bases are competitive (~19% worse) on real PDE data with broad spectral content — they do NOT actively hurt. Our probe-signal DCT-log result is therefore an artifact of the synthetic signal's narrow, non-integer frequency content, not a property of DCT bases.

Haar wavelets don't suffer this mismatch because they are localized in BOTH space and frequency — a coarse Haar wavelet captures low-frequency content regardless of whether the frequency is integer-aligned.

### Why Haar loses at k ≥ 16

At large k the random-orthogonal basis has enough rank to approximate any direction in the d=64 space, including the localized directions Haar uses. The "rank-starvation" advantage of structured bases evaporates. This is the curse-of-dimensionality working in our favor for once: at k≪d, structure helps; at k≈d/2, structure is redundant.

---

## Phase 2 G3 + G4 (no-regression, zero-alloc)

- **G3** (existing FUNCATTN tests still pass): ✅ all 22 `funcattn::tests::*` pass with `funcattn_structured_basis` enabled (17 original + 5 new).
- **G4** (`funcattn_g5_zero_alloc` still passes): ✅ the constructors are init-time only; the forward hot path is unchanged. Zero-alloc steady state preserved by construction.

---

## Decision (Plan 332 Phase 4)

- **T4.1 (promote to default)**: ❌ NOT done. Strict G1+G2 fails (DCT-log kills the AND).
- **T4.2 (auto-select structured for small k)**: ❌ NOT done. Same reason — the gate didn't pass cleanly, and auto-selection would require a runtime branch we can't justify without a clean gate.
- **T4.3 (document negative result)**: ✅ DONE — this file.
- **T4.4 (update Issue 001)**: ✅ DONE — see updated verdict in Issue 001.

### Recommended usage (documented, not enforced)

Callers who know they are doing **transport-like tasks at small k (k ≤ 8) with moderate temperature (τ ≥ 0.5)** should prefer `make_haar_packet_basis` over random-orthogonal initialization. Concretely:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "funcattn_structured_basis")]
let w_basis = if k <= 8 {
    katgpt_core::make_haar_packet_basis(k, d)
} else {
    random_orthonormal_init(k, d)  // caller's existing init
};
```

Do NOT use `make_dct_log_basis` for transport tasks — it actively hurts. It is kept in the codebase for completeness (smoother signals than this synthetic smoothing target might benefit), but the GOAT gate showed no regime where it wins.

---

## Implications for Phase 5 (Apollonian harmonics)

The plan gated Apollonian harmonics on a simpler multi-scale basis (Haar-packet) passing first. **Haar-packet passed at k≤8, τ=0.5** — the Apollonian-surrogate door is ajar, not closed.

However:
- Haar's win is narrow (+0.0846 at k=8, vs the +0.1093 achievable). Apollonian's richer geometry would need to beat Haar by a meaningful margin to justify the implementation cost.
- The loss at k≥16 and τ=0.1 means Apollonian would face the same rank-saturation and sharp-sigmoid problems.
- The k-sweep elbow at k=16 suggests the maximum addressable regime for any fixed structured basis is k∈[4, 16] — a small window.

**Recommendation for Phase 5**: do NOT implement true d-dimensional Apollonian harmonics yet. The Phase 2 result shows the achievable gain is bounded (+0.08 to +0.11 cos), localized to small k, and already mostly captured by Haar. Apollonian's extra geometric richness is unlikely to clear the implementation-cost bar. Revisit only if a concrete use case emerges where the +0.02 cos gap between Haar and the achievable bound is the blocking factor.

## TL;DR (one-line)

Haar-packet PASSES G1+G2 at τ=0.5/k≤8 (captures 77% of achievable gain, confirming the Apollonian-surrogate hypothesis); DCT-log KILLS everywhere (smooth basis can't do local transport); strict gate FAILS so feature stays opt-in, but Haar is documented as the recommended basis for small-k transport callers — and Phase 5 (true Apollonian harmonics) is deferred as not worth the implementation cost given the narrow gain window.
