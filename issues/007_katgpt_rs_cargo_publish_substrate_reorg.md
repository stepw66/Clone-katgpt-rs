# Issue 007: Make katgpt-rs Cargo-consumable — Pillar Reorganization + HLA Substrate Extraction

> **Type:** Architecture / reorganization (unblocks cargo publish + kills cross-repo duplication)
> **Status:** Audit complete — see [Plan 008](../.plans/008_katgpt_core_substrate_extraction.md) for the corrected, executable scope.
> **Audit findings (2026-06-27):**
> - **Phase 5 RESCINDED** — `Cargo.toml:9` + `release-plz.toml:9-12` lock `katgpt-rs` root as `publish = false` permanently ("dev/examples aggregator — never published. Only katgpt-core ships to crates.io"). Decision was made AFTER this issue was filed and overrides its Phase 5.
> - **Phase 1 step 1 (`types` move) ALREADY DONE** — `katgpt-core/src/types/` has 14 files; root `src/types.rs` is a thin re-export shim.
> - **Phase 2B premise INVERTED** — `cgsp` is already in core (correctly), `cce` is in root (correctly); no tier move needed.
> - **What's still real:** the cross-repo DRY violation. `riir-engine/src/` still has divergent `crate::hla`/`transformer`/`types`/`tokenizer`/`dd_tree`/`spec_types`/`mcts`/`sampling`/`delta_mem`/`simd` — confirmed via grep.
> **Owner:** develop
> **Created:** 2026-06-27
> **Cross-repo:** katgpt-rs (primary), riir-ai, riir-neuron-db (consumers). riir-train/riir-chain unaffected.
> **Origin:** User directive — "I want others to use it as easily as possible aka cargo" + HLA scattering concern.

## TL;DR

Two problems, one fix:

1. **`katgpt-rs` (root) isn't cargo-consumable** because its public surface is ~100 flat feature-gated modules with heavy non-optional deps (`plotters`, platform `metal`/`coreml`). Anonymous consumers can't `cargo add` it.
2. **The inference substrate is duplicated across repos.** `hla` (Higher-order Linear Attention) — a pillar — lives in `katgpt-rs/src/hla/`, is **copy-pasted verbatim into `riir-ai/crates/riir-engine/src/hla/`** (same `forward_hla`/`MultiLayerHlaCache` signatures), and is stored as opaque `[f32; 8]` in `riir-neuron-db::NeuronShard`. Same goes for `transformer` and `types` — `riir-engine/src/hla/forward.rs` imports `crate::transformer::{ForwardContext, TransformerWeights}` and `crate::types::{Config}`, proving those are duplicated too.

**Fix:** move the inference substrate (the pillars every repo needs) down into `katgpt-core`, the publishable leaf. Organize the root crate into tiers. Then publish `katgpt-rs` with a small stable default surface + opt-in experimental features.

This is the single change that makes the engine cargo-consumable AND eliminates the cross-repo DRY violation at the substrate layer.

## Smell Audit (full inventory — HLA was the tip)

**Root cause found:** `riir-ai/crates/riir-engine/src/lib.rs:3` documents it itself — *"Extracted from katgpt-rs (MIT, frozen at v0.1.0)"*. riir-engine is a **fork** of katgpt-rs@v0.1.0. Both sides then evolved independently for hundreds of commits. Everything present at v0.1.0 got duplicated; nothing keeps the copies in sync. HLA is just the first one I confirmed.

### Category A — Substrate duplicated in riir-engine (the smells to fix)

These modules live in `riir-engine/src/` as **own copies** (use `crate::`, not `katgpt_core::`). Each is inference mechanics — the WHAT, public per the 003 strategy — stuck in the private fork:

| Module (riir-engine path) | Uses | Smell type | Strategy-doc status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `src/hla/` | `crate::hla::kernel`, `crate::transformer`, `crate::types` | Full pillar duplicated, diverged (`*_role_aware` variants) | inference mechanics — PUBLIC |
| `src/transformer/` (gemma2, llama) | `crate::types::{self, *}` | Forward pass duplicated | inference mechanics — PUBLIC |
| `src/types.rs` | — | Foundation (Config/Rng/InferenceResult) duplicated | inference mechanics — PUBLIC |
| `src/tokenizer.rs` | `crate::types` | SentencePiece loader duplicated | inference mechanics — PUBLIC |
| `src/dd_tree.rs` | `crate::spec_types::{ConstraintPruner, TreeNode, ...}` | DDTree duplicated | **named PUBLIC engine in 003** ("DDTree, ConstraintPruner trait") |
| `src/spec_types.rs` | — | `TreeNode`/`DDTreeBranchCache`/`SpeculativeContext` duplicated; **traits already moved to `katgpt-core/src/traits.rs`** but the dependent types were left behind — half-finished extraction | PUBLIC |
| `src/mcts.rs` | `crate::game_state` | MCTS mechanics duplicated | inference mechanics — PUBLIC |
| `src/sampling.rs` | `crate::types::Rng` | CDF sampling duplicated | inference mechanics — PUBLIC |
| `src/delta_mem/` | `crate::spec_types` | DeltaMemory duplicated | inference mechanics — PUBLIC |
| `src/turboquant.rs` | `crate::types` | **Stub by design** — its own header says *"real impl lives in katgpt-rs, port when needed"*. Deferred dedup, acknowledged. | inference mechanics — PUBLIC |
| `src/simd/wasm32.rs` | reimplements `simd_dot_f32`/`simd_sum_f32`/`simd_exp_inplace` etc. | WASM SIMD128 path **reimplemented** despite `katgpt-core/src/simd/` already shipping the same kernels (`wasm32_simd128_dot_f32` etc.) | inference mechanics — PUBLIC |

### Category B — Correct composition (the pattern to replicate everywhere)

These already do it right — `use katgpt_core::` / `use katgpt_rs::` to compose public primitives, keeping only the private wiring. This is the target end state for all of Category A:

| Module | Imports from | Why it's correct |
|---|---|---|
| `analytic_lattice/asoc.rs` | `katgpt_core::analytic_lattice::{ComposerCtx, ...}` | Composes the public primitive |
| `arg_runtime/*` (6 files) | `katgpt_core::arg::{LabelId, TaxonomyNode, ...}` | `_runtime` suffix = private composition layer |
| `bom_arena/*` | `katgpt_core::{ArenaAction, BeliefPlanner, ...}` | Public primitives, private game wiring |
| `cce_runtime/*` | `katgpt_rs::cce`, `katgpt_core::cgsp` | Public primitives, private per-NPC wiring |
| `cgsp_runtime/*` | `katgpt_core::cgsp::{Direction, sigmoid}` | Public primitive, private anti-cheat/bridge |

The `_runtime` suffix is already the **de-facto boundary marker** in this codebase: bare-name module = public primitive (should live in core); `*_runtime` module = private composition (correctly in riir-engine). The fix is to make every Category A module follow the Category B pattern.

### Category C — Correctly private (must NOT move — 003 strategy compliance)

These are game product IP per 003 §"What riir-ai Can Do". The audit confirms they correctly stay in riir-engine: `adapters/`, `arena/`, `bom_arena/` (game wiring), `cce_runtime/`, `cgsp_runtime/`, `cognitive_branches_runtime/`, `committed_blend/`, `cwm_runtime/`, `entity_cognition/`, `ict_runtime/`, `neuron_vessel_runtime/`, `policy_cache/`, `swir_validation/`, `zone/`, `kg*`, `game_state.rs`, `latent_field_wiring.rs`, `role_transport.rs`. Moving any of these to the public crate would violate the "How = private" rule.

### Tier inconsistency smell (separate from duplication)

`cgsp` lives in `katgpt-core` but `cce` lives in `katgpt-rs` root. Consumers reach them inconsistently: `use katgpt_core::cgsp` vs `use katgpt_rs::cce`. Same conceptual layer (game-theoretic runtime primitives), two different tiers. `cce` should move down to core to match `cgsp`, or both move up — pick one tier for the "public game-theory primitive" layer.

### Net assessment

- **10 substrate modules duplicated** in riir-engine (Category A), all PUBLIC inference mechanics per the 003 strategy. This is a strategy-doc violation in the OTHER direction: public WHAT is stranded in a private fork, forcing the fork to maintain its own divergent copies.
- The `*_runtime` convention already marks the boundary correctly. The codebase knows the pattern; it just hasn't been applied to the v0.1.0 fork residue.
- The single biggest DRY win is the substrate chain `types → transformer/weights → hla → dd_tree/spec_types`: move it to core, delete the riir-engine copies, and every downstream repo gets one canonical source.

### Cognitive/reasoning is a NEW MOAT (the basic/GOAT split)

A category of primitives is emerging as a competitive moat beyond pure inference mechanics: **cognitive and reasoning** primitives — `cce` (correlated equilibrium), `cgsp` (curiosity-guided self-play), `clr` (claim-level reliability), `compaction`, `claim_rubric`, etc. These are the decision-level / reasoning-layer mechanisms.

The commercial split for this layer (per refined strategy doc):

- **Basic version stays PUBLIC in `katgpt-rs` root** (engine tier, not core substrate). The adoption funnel — good enough to build on, attract dependency, demonstrate the capability. Ships WITH its examples/benches/related `.md` so the public surface is legible and evaluable.
- **GOAT/Super-GOAT tuned version stays PRIVATE in `riir-*`** (the `_runtime` modules + tuned parameters + game-coupled extensions). This is the version that actually wins — the validated thresholds, the collapse-recovery tuning, the game-specific wiring. "Good enough to adopt, not good enough to win."

This is why `cce`/`cgsp` belong in root (not core): they're cognitive-layer adoption primitives, not pure substrate. And it's why their `_runtime` siblings (`cce_runtime`, `cgsp_runtime`) correctly stay private in riir-engine — the GOAT tuning is the moat. The `*_runtime` convention already encodes this split; this issue just makes it explicit in the tier model.

**Implication for the reorg:** do NOT push cognitive/reasoning primitives down to core. Core = pure inference substrate only. Root = substrate re-exports + cognitive basics + engine primitives. riir-* = GOAT versions + composition + game/chain/shard IP.

## Evidence: HLA is duplicated, not just scattered

### Where HLA lives today

| Repo | File | What it has | How it's used |
|---|---|---|---|
| `katgpt-rs` (root) | `src/hla/{mod,types,kernel,forward}.rs` | Full pillar: `HlaLayerState`, `hla_state_update`, `hla_readout`, `forward_hla`, `forward_ahla`, `generate_hla_into`, AHLA + Parallax variants | The "canonical" copy |
| `riir-ai` | `crates/riir-engine/src/hla/{forward,...}.rs` | **Same signatures**: `forward_hla`, `forward_ahla`, `generate_hla_into`, `MultiLayerHlaCache` | Active runtime — `karc_runtime`, `committed_personality_runtime`, `latent_field_wiring` features all wire into "the HLA update loop" |
| `riir-neuron-db` | `src/index.rs`, `NeuronShard.hla_moments` | Opaque `[f32; 8]` field only — no kernel | Stores HLA moments as shard embedding for `ShardIndex` retrieval |
| `katgpt-core` | (comments only) | Doc references in `analytic_lattice`, `babel_codec`, `cgsp::HlaProjectionGuide`, `branching` | Does NOT contain the kernel. `HlaProjectionGuide` borrows the name but is a generic `QualityGuide` over abstract `Direction`s |

### The smoking gun

`riir-ai/crates/riir-engine/src/hla/forward.rs:15-19`:
```rust
use crate::hla::kernel::{ahla_layer_step_role_aware, hla_layer_update_role_aware};
use crate::hla::types::{MultiLayerAhlaCache, MultiLayerHlaCache};
use crate::transformer::{ForwardContext, TransformerWeights};
use crate::types::{self, Config};
```

The `crate::` prefix means riir-engine has its **own** `hla/`, `transformer`, and `types` modules — duplicated from katgpt-rs, not imported from it. The HLA substrate was copy-pasted, then both sides evolved independently (riir-engine added `*_role_aware` variants; katgpt-rs may have diverged elsewhere). This is a silent DRY violation: two sources of truth for the same pillar, no mechanism keeping them in sync.

### Why it's structured this way (the coupling trap)

`katgpt-core` is a clean leaf (minimal deps, the SIMD/types substrate). `hla` was placed in the **root** crate because it depends on `transformer::{ForwardContext, TransformerWeights}` and `types::Config` — which are ALSO in the root crate. So moving HLA down requires moving the transformer substrate down first (or together). The pillar stack — `types` → `transformer/weights` → `hla` — is a dependency chain that all lives in the root, forcing every compute consumer to pull the whole root.

---

## Proposed reorganization

### Tier 0 — `katgpt-core` (the leaf, already on crates.io)

Move the **inference substrate** down here. These are the pillars every repo needs, with minimal deps, no game/application code:

```
crates/katgpt-core/src/
├── simd/           # ALREADY HERE
├── types.rs        # Config, Rng, etc. — MOVE FROM root src/types.rs
├── transformer/    # ForwardContext, TransformerWeights — MOVE FROM root
├── weights.rs      # MOVE FROM root
├── tokenizer/      # MOVE FROM root (if leaf-clean)
├── hla/            # MOVE FROM root src/hla/ — the case-study pillar
├── (existing core primitives: dec/, arg/, cgsp/, committed_field_blend/, ...)
```

**Migration rule for what moves to core:** a module moves down if (a) it's a pillar that riir-ai/riir-neuron-db need for *compute*, (b) it has no heavy/platform deps, (c) moving it doesn't create a cycle. `hla`, `transformer`, `types`, `weights` clearly qualify. `tokenizer` — verify deps first.

**What stays OUT of core:** anything that pulls `rayon`/`bevy_ecs`/`wasmi`/`plotters`/`metal`/`good_lp`. Those are engine/app concerns.

### Tier 1 — `katgpt-rs` (root, the engine — becomes publishable)

Organize the remaining ~100 flat modules into subdirs by role. **Mirror the existing `_runtime` convention** as the organizing principle — bare-name = public primitive (re-export from core), `*_runtime`-style suffix = composition layer:

```
src/
├── lib.rs
├── primitives/         # GOAT-gated research primitives (the WHAT), each feature-flagged.
│                       # Candidates to also push DOWN to core over time: cce, clr, compaction
│                       # (matches cgsp already being in core). Until then, live here as public.
│   ├── cce/            # tier-inconsistency candidate (see Smell Audit) — push to core to match cgsp
│   ├── clr/  compaction/  cgsp.rs  claim_rubric/  ...
│   └── (GOAT-passed default-on primitives form the stable publishable surface)
├── inference/          # higher-level inference wiring built ON core substrate
│   ├── attn_match/  speculative/  pruners/  still_kv/  turboquant/
│   └── (these are engine-tier, not substrate — depend on core's transformer/hla)
├── games/              # game engines + NPC brains — clearly app-level, opt-in features
│   ├── percepta/  bomber/  go/  sudoku/  monopoly/  npc_brain_router.rs
│   └── (NOT in katgpt-core — game IP stays public-engine per 003, but separate tier)
├── backends/           # platform backends (optional, target-gated) — gpu/ane/inference_router
└── bench/              # benchmark harnesses
```

**Critical:** after the substrate (Category A) moves to core, root `src/hla/`, `src/transformer.rs`, `src/types.rs`, `src/weights.rs`, `src/dd_tree.rs`, `src/spec_types.rs`, `src/mcts.rs`, `src/sampling.rs`, `src/tokenizer/`, `src/delta_mem/` all become thin `pub use katgpt_core::{...};` re-exports. No call site in katgpt-rs or its examples breaks. riir-engine deletes its copies and imports from core the same way `analytic_lattice` already does.

This is a **pure move + re-export** refactor — no logic changes. `lib.rs` keeps re-exporting at the top level so existing `use katgpt::clr_vote` call sites don't break.

### Feature-flag stability tiers (enables cargo publish)

Reuse the existing ~100 feature flags as the stability contract:

| Tier | Examples | Default | Semver promise |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stable** | `simd`/`hla`/`transformer` (in core), core re-exports | ON | Breaking = major bump |
| **Engine** | `attn_match`, `compaction` (default-on, GOAT-passed) | ON | Best-effort, breaking = minor in 0.x |
| **Experimental** | most research primitives (opt-in) | OFF | No promise behind the flag |

This is exactly how `tokio`/`bevy` publish while churning. Default-off features can break freely; default-on is the curated surface.

---

## Making `katgpt-rs` publishable (the cargo goal)

After reorg, the remaining blockers to `cargo add katgpt-rs`:

1. **Audit non-optional deps.** Most heavy ones are already `optional = true` (`bevy_ecs`, `wasmi`, `good_lp`, `reqwest`, `rustfft`). **`plotters` is the blocker** — make it optional (only `plot.rs` + benches use it). `rayon`/`blake3`/`half`/`bytemuck`/`serde*`/`postcard`/`toml` are fine (small, leaf-ish, broadly acceptable).
2. **Platform deps stay target-gated** (`metal`/`coreml-native` under `[target.'cfg(target_os = "macos")']` — already correct, no change).
3. **Scrub hard `riir-*` code deps** from public files (name-drops for bragging are fine per user; only real `use riir_*` / path deps into private repos must go — there shouldn't be any in the public crate, but verify).
4. **release-plz config**: add `katgpt-rs` as a second published package with its own `git_tag_name = "katgpt-rs-v{{version}}"`. Versions stay **independent** (core evolves on its own semver; root starts at `0.1.0`). Do NOT couple versions — that was the earlier-discarded idea.
5. **x86_64 verifies clean** ✅ (Issue 006 cleared this for core; root crate will inherit once it publishes).

---

## Cross-repo consumer cleanup (the DRY payoff — consolidate, don't blindly delete)

Once the substrate is in `katgpt-core`, the riir-engine copies get retired — but **consolidation, not deletion**. riir-engine forked at v0.1.0 and some copies DIVERGED WITH IMPROVEMENTS. The rule:

- **For each Category A module:** diff the riir-engine copy against the new core canonical. If riir-engine added anything (a variant, an optimization, a bug fix, a `*_role_aware` extension) → PORT it into core first, behind a feature flag if needed. Only then delete the riir-engine copy.
- **Known divergence to consolidate:**
  - `hla/` — riir-engine added `forward_hla_role_aware` / `forward_ahla_role_aware` + `role_transport` wiring. Port the role-aware kernel variants into core's `hla` (behind `hla_role_aware` feature); keep riir-engine's `role_transport.rs` as the private composition (Category C).
  - `dd_tree`/`spec_types` — riir-engine's copy may have game-coupled additions; port the generic parts, leave game-specific in riir-engine.
  - `turboquant.rs` — riir-engine has a STUB; katgpt-rs has the real impl. Consolidation = riir-engine consumes the real one, stub deleted.
  - `simd/wasm32.rs` — riir-engine reimplemented WASM SIMD128; katgpt-core already ships it. Diff for any riir-engine-only kernel improvements, port if any, then delete the reimplementation.

**After consolidation:**
- **riir-ai/riir-engine**: deletes every Category A copy, imports from `katgpt_core` the same way `analytic_lattice`/`arg_runtime` already do. Zero divergent copies remain.
- **riir-neuron-db**: unchanged structurally (still stores `[f32; 8]`), but can now optionally call `katgpt_core::hla` kernels if it ever needs compute, without pulling the root engine.
- **katgpt-rs root**: `src/hla/`, `src/transformer.rs`, `src/types.rs`, `src/weights.rs`, `src/dd_tree.rs`, `src/spec_types.rs`, `src/mcts.rs`, `src/sampling.rs`, `src/tokenizer/`, `src/delta_mem/` become thin `pub use katgpt_core::{...};` re-exports (back-compat for existing call sites).

---

## Migration path (incremental, no big-bang)

Each phase is independently shippable and reversible:

- [ ] **Phase 1 — Substrate extraction to core.** Move the full Category A chain, in dependency order (each move is its own commit, full test suite green before next):
  1. `types` (foundation — move first, surfaces any hidden deps)
  2. `transformer` + `weights` (depends on types)
  3. `tokenizer` (depends on types — audit deps first, see Risk 4)
  4. `hla` (depends on transformer/types — port `*_role_aware` variants behind a core feature flag)
  5. `dd_tree` + `spec_types` types (traits already in `core/traits.rs`; move the dependent `TreeNode`/`DDTreeBranchCache`/`SpeculativeContext` to join them)
  6. `mcts`, `sampling`, `delta_mem` (leaf inference mechanics)
  7. Delete `riir-engine/src/simd/wasm32.rs`, consume `katgpt_core::simd` wasm32 path instead
  Each step: copy to core, `pub use katgpt_core::*` re-export at root, run tests. Core version bump: `0.3.0`.
- [ ] **Phase 2 — Cross-repo dedup.** In riir-ai/riir-engine, delete every Category A copy, import from `katgpt_core` the same way `analytic_lattice`/`arg_runtime` already do. Verify `forward_hla`/`dd_tree` bit-identical on existing tests in both repos. This is the single biggest DRY win.
- [ ] **Phase 2b — Cognitive/reasoning tier consistency (move UP, not down).** `cce` is in root, `cgsp` is in core — but both are cognitive/reasoning primitives, not substrate. **Move `cgsp` UP from core to root** to join `cce`, bringing its examples/benches/related `.md` along. Root becomes the home of the public cognitive/reasoning layer; core stays pure inference substrate (SIMD/types/transformer/hla/dd_tree). Do NOT push `cce` down to core — that was the wrong direction. Tier model: core = substrate, root = engine + cognitive basics, riir-* = GOAT/Super-GOAT tuning + composition.
- [ ] **Phase 3 — Root crate reorg.** Move root `src/*` into `primitives/`/`inference/`/`games/`/`backends/` subdirs per the `_runtime` convention. Top-level `pub use` re-exports preserve all call sites. Pure refactor.
- [ ] **Phase 4 — Dep audit for publish.** Make `plotters` optional. Verify `cargo check --no-default-features` clean on root.
- [ ] **Phase 5 — Publish katgpt-rs.** Add to `release-plz.toml` as second package (`git_tag_name = "katgpt-rs-v{{version}}"`), first publish `0.1.0`. Document feature-flag stability tiers in README.

Phases 1–2 are the high-value, low-risk core (kills the duplication, unblocks clean consumption). Phases 3–5 are the cargo-publish polish. **Phase 1+2 alone deliver most of the value** — any repo can then `cargo add katgpt-core` and get the full inference substrate including HLA, DDTree, transformer.

---

## Risks

1. **Moving `transformer`/`types` to core may surface hidden deps** (e.g., `Config` referencing something in root). **Mitigation:** move `types` first (it's the dependency root), find out, deal with it incrementally. Don't move the whole chain in one commit.
2. **riir-engine's HLA diverged** (`*_role_aware` variants, `role_transport` wiring). **Mitigation:** role-aware is likely a superset — port the HLA kernel variants into core's `hla` behind a feature flag; keep riir-engine's `role_transport.rs` as the private composition layer (it's Category C). Phase 2 reconciliation.
3. **Version churn.** Core goes to `0.3.0` (new modules), root starts `0.1.0`. **Mitigation:** both are `0.x`, expected to churn. Document in READMEs.
4. **`tokenizer` may have deps that disqualify it from core** (SentencePiece C++ via `sentencepiece-sys`). **Mitigation:** audit first; if it pulls a C++ build dep, leave `tokenizer` in root and only move the trait/types. The riir-engine `tokenizer.rs` is already `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]`-gated — core must preserve that.
5. **`dd_tree`/`spec_types` reconciliation** — riir-engine's copy may have diverged from whatever katgpt-rs root has (root `spec_types.rs` doesn't even exist per the audit). **Mitigation:** treat core as the new canonical source; port any riir-engine-only improvements during Phase 2; the traits are already in core so the hard part (the trait boundary) is done.
6. **Game-state coupling** — `mcts.rs` imports `crate::game_state::GameState`, which is Category C (game IP). **Mitigation:** `mcts` the algorithm (tree policy, UCB1, backprop) is public mechanics; `GameState` the trait stays wherever it is. Move the generic MCTS, parameterize over a `Game` trait from core if needed, leave game-specific impls in riir-engine.

---

## Acceptance

- [ ] Phase 1: all Category A modules live in `katgpt-core`, re-exported from root. `cargo test -p katgpt-core --lib` + `cargo test -p katgpt-rs --lib` green on arm64 + x86_64.
- [ ] Phase 2: riir-engine has zero Category A duplicates; all consume `katgpt_core::`. `forward_hla`/`dd_tree`/`mcts` tests bit-identical to pre-move.
- [ ] Phase 2b: `cce` in core, `cce_runtime` imports updated.
- [ ] Phase 3: root `src/` organized into subdirs; no call-site breakage (all `use katgpt::*` resolve via re-exports).
- [ ] Phase 4: `cargo check --no-default-features` clean on root; `plotters` optional.
- [ ] Phase 5: `katgpt-rs@0.1.0` live on crates.io; `cargo add katgpt-rs` works.
- [ ] This issue updated with GOAT/bench evidence at each phase (per AGENTS.md "dont defer benchmark task").

## Open questions (need your call)

1. **Phase 1 scope:** the full 7-step Category A chain above, or a subset (e.g. just the `types`→`transformer`→`hla` core that unblocks the HLA case study first)? Recommend the full chain — anything left behind stays duplicated.
2. **`tokenizer`:** move to core (SentencePiece dep risk) or leave in root? Needs the Risk 4 audit.
3. **`mcts`/`dd_tree` generic-vs-game split:** how aggressively to parameterize over core `Game`/`Node` traits vs. leave game-coupled copies in riir-engine?
4. **Go order:** Phase 1+2 first (kills duplication, highest value), defer 3–5? Or push all the way to publish in one go?
