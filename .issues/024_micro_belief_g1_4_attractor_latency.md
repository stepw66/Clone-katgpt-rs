# Issue 024: MicroRecurrentBeliefState G1.4 Attractor Latency (>100ns/step)

**Date:** 2026-06-16
**Plan:** [katgpt-rs/.plans/276_micro_recurrent_belief_state.md](../.plans/276_micro_recurrent_belief_state.md) — Phase 1, T1.11 / T1.18
**Status:** Open — does NOT block Phase 1 exit (G1.1, G1.2, G1.3, G1.5 all pass). Blocks promotion of `micro_belief` to default-on.

---

## Symptom

`AttractorKernel::step()` at `dim=32` measures **~270 ns/step** in release on Apple Silicon arm64, exceeding the Plan 276 G1.4 target of **<100 ns/step**.

The HLA baseline (`ReconstructionState::evolve_hla_simd`) is an order of magnitude faster because it is a leaky integrator (elementwise updates, no matvec). The attractor family does a full `dim × dim` matvec plus 32 sigmoid calls, which is fundamentally more work.

## Root Cause (profiled)

1. **32× `fast_sigmoid` calls per step** — each calls `exp()` (~5ns each) = ~160ns just for sigmoids.
2. **64× `simd_dot_f32` calls of length 32** — at `dim=32`, the function-call overhead into the NEON/AVX2 dispatch dominates over the actual FMA work. The 4-row chunking helps ILP but doesn't eliminate per-call overhead.
3. **Stack buffer copy** — `[f32; 1024]` zero-init + final copy back to `state` adds ~20ns.

## Mitigations to Explore (in priority order)

### M1: Vectorize the sigmoid (highest impact)

Replace the 32 scalar `fast_sigmoid` calls with a single SIMD-vectorized sigmoid pass over the 32-element activation buffer. The `wide` crate or `std::simd` can compute 4–8 sigmoids in parallel via a Padé approximation:

```
σ(x) ≈ (0.5 + 0.25·x) for |x| < 2      // piecewise linear
σ(x) ≈ clamp(x·0.125 + 0.5, 0, 1)       // very rough
σ(x) = 1/(1+e^{-x})                      // exact, vectorize via exp_ps
```

The `exp_ps` intrinsic (NEON: `vexpq_f32`, AVX2: `_mm256_exp_ps` if available via `sleef` or manual Taylor) would give 4 sigmoids per FMA pipeline cycle. Expected: 32 sigmoids in ~20ns instead of ~160ns. Saves ~140ns.

### M2: Inline the dot products at small dim

At `dim=32`, the `simd_dot_f32` function-call overhead is significant. An inlined `[f32; 32]`-specialized dot (unrolled 8-wide) would eliminate the dispatch cost. Expected: ~50ns saved.

### M3: Fuse matvec + sigmoid + clamp into a single pass

Currently: compute all activations, then sigmoid all, then clamp all. Fusing into a single row-loop with inlined sigmoid (M1) avoids the intermediate buffer and the second pass.

### M4: Reduce dim

The plan defaults to `dim=32` to match Plan 255's L1 budget. If M1–M3 don't close the gap, consider `dim=16` as the attractor default (the leaky integrator stays at `dim=8` to match HLA). Halving dim roughly halves the matvec cost.

### M5: Accept the latency, demote attractor to sub-flag

If M1–M4 don't reach <100ns, keep `micro_belief` opt-in (do NOT promote to default). The trait unification + LeakyIntegrator wrapper (which IS fast) still ship as the only default-on output. The attractor family stays behind `micro_belief_attractor` sub-flag for experimentation. This is the plan's T1.17 fallback path.

## Benchmark Numbers (2026-06-16, Apple Silicon arm64, release)

| Variant | ns/step | Target | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AttractorKernel::step()` dim=32 (current) | **270.47** (criterion median, T1.14) | <100 | FAIL |
| `LeakyIntegrator::step()` dim=32 (Family C, baseline) | **35.73** (criterion median, T1.14) | <100 | PASS |
| `LatentThoughtKernel::step()` dim=32 K=1 | **270.86** (criterion median, T1.14) | attractor ±5% | PASS (matches attractor) |
| `LatentThoughtKernel::step()` dim=32 K=3 | **811.46** (criterion median, T1.14) | ~3× attractor | PASS (exactly 3.00×) |
| `project_to_scalars` K=5 dim=32 | **22.34** (criterion median, T1.14) | <50 | PASS |

## TL;DR

G1.4 latency gate fails for `AttractorKernel` at dim=32 (~270ns vs <100ns target). Root cause: 32 scalar sigmoid calls + 64 small-dim dot products with function-call overhead. Does NOT block Phase 1 exit — G1.1/G1.2/G1.3/G1.5 pass; the trait unification + LeakyIntegrator (which is fast) ship regardless. Attractor stays opt-in behind `micro_belief` until M1 (vectorized sigmoid) or M4 (dim=16) closes the gap. Filed per Plan 276 R2 mitigation.

## Update (simd_sigmoid feature — 2026-06-16)

**M1 implemented**: `simd_sigmoid_tanh_clamp_inplace` added to `simd.rs` — fused
NEON/AVX2 pass computing `(2·σ(a+q)−1).clamp(-clamp, clamp)` in one traversal.
Gated behind the `simd_sigmoid` Cargo feature (default-off). Both `step()` and
`sample_k_states` switch together, preserving G1.3 bit-identical σ=0 degeneracy.

**Discovered**: the existing `neon_exp_inplace` / `avx2_exp_inplace` Cephes
polynomial was WRONG — it used add-nested coefficients `1 + g*(1 + g*(0.5 +
g*(1/3 + ...)))` which expands to `1 + g + g²/2 + g³/3 + g⁴/4 + ...` instead of
the correct Taylor series `1 + g + g²/2 + g³/6 + g⁴/24 + ...`. The error was
hidden because softmax inputs are shifted by max (g ≈ 0, error negligible) and
existing tests only compared SIMD-vs-SIMD. The new sigmoid helper uses the
correct Horner form matching `cephes_exp_scalar`. **This is a pre-existing bug
in `neon_exp_inplace` that should be filed as a separate issue.**

### Benchmark results (Apple Silicon arm64, release)

| Variant | Scalar | SIMD | Ratio | Target | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AttractorKernel::step()` dim=32 | 236 ns | **209 ns** | 1.13× faster | <100 ns | **G1.4 FAIL** |
| `sample_k_states` K=8 dim=32 | 660 ns | **390 ns** | 1.69× faster | ≤2× step | **G3 PASS** (390/209 = 1.87×) |

### Verdict: **PARTIAL PASS**

- **G3 (Issue 025) PASSES**: K=8 drops from 2.79× to 1.87× step(), under the 2× target.
- **G1.4 (this issue) STILL FAILS**: step() drops 236→209 ns but is still 2× over the
  100 ns target. The bottleneck is NOT the sigmoid (which M1 fixed) — it's the
  32×32 matvec (1024 FMAs) which dominates at ~190 ns. M1 saved ~27 ns on the
  sigmoid chain; the matvec needs M2 (inline dot products) or M4 (dim=16) to
  close the remaining ~109 ns gap.

### Recommendation

- **Promote `simd_sigmoid` to default-on for `bom_sampling`**: G3 passes, and the
  sigmoid vectorization is strictly beneficial (1.13–1.69× across step/K=8).
  No correctness regression (G1.3 holds, 348 lib tests pass).
  → **APPLIED 2026-06-17 (Issue 025 closed).** `bom_sampling` now auto-enables
  `simd_sigmoid`.
- **Keep `micro_belief` opt-in**: G1.4 still fails. The attractor family needs M2
  (inline simd_dot_f32 at small dim) or M4 (dim=16 default) before promotion.
- **File follow-up issue**: the `neon_exp_inplace` polynomial bug should be fixed
  separately — it affects all exp/softmax callers, not just sigmoid.
  → **DONE as Issue 027 (FIXED 2026-06-16).**
