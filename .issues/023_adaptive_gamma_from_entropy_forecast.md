## Problem

`Config::draft_lookahead` (the speculative-decode draft length γ) is a **static** field. It is set once at config time (`micro`=8, `small_target`=5, `bpe`=8, `gemma2_2b`=0, `game`=0) and never adapted at runtime. This wastes compute when the target model's entropy rises mid-generation (acceptance rate drops, but we still draft γ tokens), and leaves throughput on the table when entropy is low (we could safely draft more).

Bebop (arXiv:2606.12370 §3) proves the acceptance rate is **linearly bounded by target entropy**:

```
α ≈ a − b · H(p)
```

with `H(p) = −Σ p_v ln p_v` computable in one pass over the next-token logits, and `a, b` fitted once from warmup. The bound is remarkably stable across model sizes, tasks, and training stages. The paper explicitly flags adaptive-γ from this forecast as future work (§7.6) **without proof** — so this issue is a GOAT-gated experiment, not a guaranteed win.

## Current State (verified)

- `llmexec_guard` (`src/llmexec_guard.rs`) already maps entropy → verification tier, but via **ad-hoc sigmoid** `sigmoid(-steepness·(entropy−0.5) + depth_bonus)`, not a calibrated α forecast. It gates *which verifier runs*, not *how many tokens to draft*.
- `AdaptiveTraceCompactor::observe_entropy` (`src/attn_match/adaptive_cot.rs:159`) already computes EMA entropy per trace — reusable for free.
- `freq_bandit` / `fold_bandit` / `meta_router` already use `acceptance_rate` as bandit reward — the forecast can serve as a Bayesian prior.
- `LeviathanVerifier` already does p/q rejection sampling (the paper's core inference mechanism) — no change needed there.

## Proposed Optimization

1. Add `AcceptanceForecast { a, b, ema_entropy, ema_alpha }` primitive (two-parameter linear model, O(1) forecast after O(vocab) entropy computation, zero-allocation, fits in L1). See Research 243 §4 for the sketch.
2. Feature flag: `adaptive_gamma_forecast` (default-OFF until GOAT gate passes).
3. Wire the forecast into `draft_lookahead` adaptation: `γ_t = clamp(ceil(L_target / α_forecast), γ_min, γ_max)`.
4. Optional: skip speculative decode entirely when `α_forecast < α_breakeven` (single-token path is cheaper than draft+verify cycle).
5. Optional: feed `α_forecast` as a prior into `freq_bandit` to speed convergence.

## GOAT Gate

Benchmark `accepted_tokens/sec` and `μs/step` with feature ON vs OFF, on a workload with **varying entropy** (long CoT reasoning traces where entropy rises mid-generation, per paper Fig. 12b; agentic multi-turn per paper §7.7). 

- **Promote to default** if ≥5% throughput gain with no quality regression (output distribution unchanged — RS preserves unbiased sampling regardless of γ).
- **Demote `llmexec_guard`'s ad-hoc sigmoid** if the calibrated forecast strictly dominates it on the same tier-routing benchmark.
- **Close as won't-fix** if gain < 5% or if the EMA entropy overhead negates the γ-adaptation benefit.

## Risks

- **Unproven in the source paper.** §7.6 is a one-sentence suggestion. The linear bound is proven; the adaptive-γ throughput gain is not. This issue exists to produce that proof (or disproof) for our stack.
- **EMA lag.** Entropy can spike faster than the EMA tracks (α=0.1 → ~10-token lag). May need a min(raw_h, ema_h) guard for spike protection (we already have `RejectionReason::EntropySpike` in TRD for this).
- **Fit cost.** `a, b` must be fitted from warmup data. If the fit is unstable across workloads, the forecast is useless. Paper Fig. 1a suggests it is stable, but that's for Qwen3.5/3.6/3.7 — we need to verify on our models.
- **Interaction with `belief_drafter`.** `belief_drafter_entropy_threshold` is a static 2.0. The forecast could replace it, but the interaction needs testing.

## Tasks

- [x] **T1** Implement `AcceptanceForecast` primitive in `src/speculative/acceptance_forecast.rs`, with `observe_and_forecast` + `adaptive_gamma` + `fit_from_warmup` + `forecast_alpha_current`. 20/20 unit tests pass.
- [x] **T2** Add feature flag `adaptive_gamma_forecast` (default-OFF, also in `full`).
- [x] **T3** `fit_from_warmup` OLS constructor implemented + tested (recovers known line, handles degenerate, clamps).
- [x] **T4** Wired `γ_t = adaptive_gamma(...)` into `LeviathanVerifier::speculate()`, replacing static `draft_lookahead` when feature ON. Uses a shadow `Config` clone with overridden `draft_lookahead`.
- [x] **T5** Benchmark on entropy-varying workload (`bench_023_adaptive_gamma.goat.rs`). **Result: -9.25% throughput (release).** KL = 0.000000 (quality preserved). Forecast overhead 0.529 μs/step (3.2%).
- [x] **T6** GOAT decision: **keep-opt-in** (do NOT promote to default). See closure rationale below.

## Closure rationale (2026-06-20)

**GOAT verdict: keep-opt-in (do NOT promote to default).** The benchmark measured **-9.25% throughput** (release, batched-verify cost model) with adaptive γ ON vs static γ=8 OFF, far below the +5% promotion bar. The output-distribution KL was 0.000000 nats (rejection sampling preserves the target distribution regardless of γ — the quality invariant holds). Forecast computation overhead was 0.529 μs/step (3.2% of the 16.53 μs step cost).

**Root cause of the negative result:** the paper's formula `γ = ceil(L_target / α)` *increases* γ when the forecast acceptance rate α drops (high entropy). This is correct for tree-based spec decode where the target forward cost is amortised over all drafted positions (constant C_verify regardless of γ), but counterproductive when draft cost scales linearly with γ (our model: `C_total = γ·C_draft + C_verify + C_fixed`). At low α, increasing γ adds draft cost without proportionally increasing accepted tokens — the marginal token is more likely to be rejected.

**What landed behind the flag (default-OFF, GOAT-gated):**
- `src/speculative/acceptance_forecast.rs` — `AcceptanceForecast` primitive with zero-alloc `entropy_nats_zero_alloc` (2-pass, no Vec/Box), `fit_from_warmup` OLS constructor, `observe_and_forecast`, `adaptive_gamma`, `forecast_alpha_current`. 20/20 unit tests.
- `LeviathanVerifier::with_forecast()` + shadow-config γ override in `speculate()`.
- `tests/bench_023_adaptive_gamma.goat.rs` — GOAT gate benchmark with real-measured forecast overhead.

**Why keep-opt-in instead of close-as-won't-fix:** the primitive and the proven linear entropy–acceptance bound (`α ≈ a − b·H`) are both correct and reusable. The negative result is specific to the `γ = ceil(L/α)` *formula* under the current non-batched verification cost model. Two conditions would flip the verdict:
1. **Batched target verification** (one forward scores all γ positions) — then increasing γ at low α becomes net-positive because C_verify is constant.
2. **A throughput-optimal γ formula** (e.g. `γ_opt = argmax_γ E[accepted(γ,α)] / (γ·C_draft + C_verify)`) instead of the paper's target-acceptance-length formula. This would *decrease* γ at low α, saving wasted draft compute.

**Not demoting `llmexec_guard`:** the ad-hoc sigmoid gate in `src/llmexec_guard.rs` gates *which verifier runs* (a different decision), not *how many tokens to draft*. The two are orthogonal; this benchmark does not compare them. A separate benchmark would be needed to demote `llmexec_guard`.

**Commits:**
- `feat(spec-decode): add AcceptanceForecast primitive + adaptive_gamma_forecast flag (Issue 023)`
- `test(spec-decode): add bench_023_adaptive_gamma.goat.rs GOAT gate`
- `docs(023): close — keep-opt-in (GOAT gate failed: -9.25% throughput)`
