# Seed-Route Consensus for GPart

**Source**: Plan 257 (GPart Isometric Partition Adapter) — Deferred Idea 4
**Priority**: Low
**Status**: CLOSED (blocked on multi-node consensus layer — not yet built)
**Depends**: Plan 257, multi-node consensus layer

**Closure rationale (2026-06-20):** All four acceptance criteria are blocked on a multi-node consensus layer that does not yet exist in katgpt-rs. GPart's `commitment()` (BLAKE3 of partition matrix) is the only piece present today; the protocol, exchange, and quorum verification all need the missing layer. Reopen when the consensus layer lands.

## Summary
Use GPart's seed-derived partition assignments as a deterministic routing key for consensus. Two nodes with the same seed must produce identical partition matrices — this property enables seed-route consensus for distributed inference validation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [-] Multi-node consensus layer must exist first (blocked on multi-node consensus layer)
- [-] Define seed-route protocol (seed → P → commitment → quorum verify) (blocked on above)
- [-] Implement seed exchange in ChainConsensus (blocked on above)
- [-] Test determinism across simulated nodes (blocked on above)

## Notes
- GPart's `commitment()` already produces BLAKE3 hash of partition matrix
- Natural fit for quorum commit since seed → P is deterministic
