# Issue 011 — Remaining test failures from 2026-06-29 full run

**Status:** B1–B4 resolved (2026-06-29, follow-up commit); G1 + thermal items still open.
**Discovered:** 2026-06-29 full `cargo test --workspace --all-features` run (debug, ~16-core parallel, thermal-throttled host).
**Context:** This run unblocked three separate compile failures and fixed two real bugs:
- Workspace compile (commit `0482eee0`): `katgpt_rs::weights::ContiguousWeights` → `katgpt_rs::ContiguousWeights` (leftover from the microgpt→katgpt rename `acf08551`).
- `cargo bench` release compile (commit `78d80c18`): `sdar_absorb` tests + `bench_sdar_gated_modelless` referenced `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`-gated APIs ungated; `depth_invariance` feature didn't propagate to `katgpt-micro-belief` (E0599 on `AttractorKernel::audit_depth_invariance`).
- Two real bugs (commit `db1ba7a3`): sleep sliding-window eviction wiped shifted KV via `reset()`; sr2am `decision_stats` under-counted under `sia_feedback`.
This issue tracks what remains. Bench + examples summary appended at the bottom.

## Already resolved in this run (do not touch)

- `tests/bench_102_tilert_pipeline_goat.rs` compile break — import path corrected.
- `sleep::eviction::sliding_window_retains_recent` — `sliding_window_evict` called `reset()` post-`copy_within`, zeroing the shifted entries. Fixed via new `MultiLayerKVCache::set_fill_pos`.
- `pruners::bomber::sr2am_player::test_sr2am_player_decision_stats` — under `sia_feedback` the configurator can pick `HarnessUpdate`/`WeightUpdate`, tracked in `feedback_decision_stats()` not the 4-tuple. Test now sums both.

## Confirmed flaky / environmental (NOT bugs — leave alone)

These pass single-threaded with `--test-threads=1` and fail only under parallel test load + thermal throttling. They are perf-budget assertions with hardcoded ns/s gates that the host cannot hold under 16-way debug-mode contention. Do not relax the thresholds to mask this — re-verify on a cool host first.

- [ ] `pruners::workflow_lattice::tests::test_bench_lattice_vs_noop` — 737.9ns > 500ns budget under load; passes alone.
- [ ] `speculative::nf_flow::tests::test_bench_flow_score_v128_t5` — 15.4µs > 10µs budget under load (test explicitly annotates "debug"); passes alone.
- [ ] `ruliology::tests::benchmarks::tests::bench_enumerate_fsm_3_states` — 11.78s > 10s budget under parallel contention; passes alone (~5s single-threaded).

## Real bugs needing root-cause work (deterministic, fail single-threaded)

### B1 — `iso_quant::rotation::tests::test_non_multiple_of_4` — RESOLVED
- `src/iso_quant/rotation.rs:373`
- **Root cause:** NOT a math bug — a **test design bug**. The partial-group
  (dim not multiple of 4) forward rotation zero-pads to 4D, rotates, and
  **discards** the rotated tail (`r[2], r[3]`). The inverse path re-pads
  with zeros, so it cannot recover the discarded components — the loss is
  fundamental, not a code bug. Verified by scratch program: forward on
  `[9,10,0,0]` → `[-0.5, 9.5, 0.5, -9.5]`, stored `[-0.5, 9.5]`, inverse of
  `[-0.5, 9.5, 0, 0]` → `[4.5, 5.0]` (wrong); inverse of the full
  `[-0.5, 9.5, 0.5, -9.5]` → `[9, 10, 0, 0]` (correct roundtrip).
- **Fix:** adopted the `planar_quant::rotation::test_odd_dim_roundtrip`
  convention — the CALLER pads the buffer to the next multiple of the group
  size. The rotation functions are then trivially invertible on the padded
  buffer (the partial group becomes a full 4D group of zeros, roundtripped
  exactly). Test now pads dim=10 → padded=12, asserts 1e-4 roundtrip on the
  real elements + zero preservation on the padded tail. All 11 iso_quant
  rotation tests pass; production callers (`IsoQuantKVCache`, always
  multiple-of-4 kv_dim) are unaffected.

### B2 — `speculative::flashar_anchor::tests::test_anchor_then_fill_reduces_steps` — RESOLVED
- `src/speculative/flashar_anchor.rs:565`
- **Root cause:** NOT a code bug — a **test setup bug**. The test used
  `TransformerWeights::new` (random initialization). A random bidirectional
  model on all-mask input produces a degenerate "always emit the same token"
  output that converges in 1 step (baseline `steps_used=1`, all positions
  emit token 15). The anchors break this degeneracy, so the fill must do
  honest denoising work (`fill_steps_used=8`, never converges on position 2).
  The comparison `fill ≤ baseline` thus compares "honest work" vs "degenerate
  shortcut" and is inverted for random weights.
- **Fix:** train a mini D2F model in the test using the existing
  `train_mini_dllm` + `generate_pattern_dataset` recipe (same as
  `speculative::d2f::tests::test_decode_with_trained_model`). With trained
  weights: `fill_steps=1 <= baseline_steps=2`, `step_reduction=1`. Added
  `make_trained_weights()` helper.

### B3 — `speculative::flashar_anchor::tests::test_anchor_then_fill_produces_valid_output` — RESOLVED
- `src/speculative/flashar_anchor.rs:490`
- **Root cause:** same as B2 — random weights left position 2 perpetually
  masked (`best_prob` oscillated 0.11–0.32 across 8 steps, never reaching
  `tau_conf=0.7`).
- **Fix:** same as B2 — use trained weights. Fill converges, all 8 tokens
  non-mask.

### B4 — `pruners::bomber::rmsd_player::tests::test_compute_sdar_reward_in_danger` — RESOLVED
- `src/pruners/bomber/rmsd_player.rs:691`
- **Root cause:** the test asserted `reward < 0.5` for `(true, 0.8, 0)`, but
  the formula `survival*0.5 + safety*0.35 + completeness*0.15` evaluates to
  **0.57** for that input. The assertion is **mathematically unsatisfiable**
  alongside the other three reward tests: `alive_safe` forces `ws+wy=0.85`,
  `all_zero` forces `wy=0.35`, hence `ws=0.50`, hence `in_danger` =
  `0.50 + 0.2*0.35 = 0.57 > 0.5`. No linear weight set satisfies all four.
- **Decision:** formula is the source of truth — 3/4 rmsd tests + all 4
  sibling `sdar_player.rs` tests match it, and the `sdar_player` version of
  this exact test computes `expected` from the formula (the established
  convention). Aligned `rmsd_player::test_compute_sdar_reward_*` with the
  `sdar_player` pattern: compute `expected` from the weights, assert at
  1e-6. Kept a weaker secondary assertion (`reward < 0.85`) to confirm danger
  is still penalized relative to the safe case.
- **Side note (not fixed here):** the doc comment "same weights as
  `RubricTemplate::bomber()`" is inaccurate — the template uses `[4.0, 2.0,
  1.0]` (normalized `[0.571, 0.286, 0.143]`) while the function hardcodes
  `[0.5, 0.35, 0.15]`. The hardcoded weights predate the template and are
  what every other test in both files expects; retuning them to match the
  template is a separate decision that would change reward magnitudes and
  break downstream SDAR/RMSD training baselines.

## GOAT-gate failing by design (not a bug to silence)

### G1 — `still_kv::integration_tests::goat_t24_compact_cache_quality`
- `src/still_kv/mod.rs:704`
- 1024×8×64 compact-cache quality gate: cos_sim at 8× compression is 0.0503 (threshold 0.70), 16× is 0.1045 (threshold 0.50), 32× is 0.1155 (threshold 0.30). Best strategy at 8× is `MuxSuperposition` (cos_sim 0.2021).
- This is the StillKV promotion gate deliberately failing — the feature is not yet good enough to promote. **Do not lower the thresholds.** The fix is improving query-bank initialization / compaction strategy, tracked separately. Grandfathered under the UQ "Report the Floor" rule (`.issues/010`) and must clear the conformal-naive floor before re-gate.

## Bench results (2026-06-29, thermal-throttled host)

After fixing the release compile (commit `78d80c18`), ran every bench target isolated with continue-on-fail:

| Package | Total | Pass | Fail |
|---------|-------|------|------|
| katgpt-rs | 31 | 30 | 1 |
| katgpt-core | 33 | 33 | 0 |

The single failure is `fpcg_probe_forecast_bench` (katgpt-rs): G6 perf gate at `d_model=4096` measured 873.95ns vs the 200ns budget (0.32×). Smaller dims passed; only the 4096 size tripped. This is a perf-budget gate inflated by thermal — consistent with the predicted −30–40% degrade. Note `bench_319_geometric_product_goat` (D=8 185.9ns vs <150ns) failed under the initial parallel `cargo bench --workspace` run but PASSED when re-run isolated on a slightly cooler core — confirming these absolute-latency gates are thermal-sensitive, not real regressions. Re-gate both on a cool host.

## Examples results (2026-06-29)

- `cargo build --examples --all-features` — **211/211 compile clean**.
- Smoke-ran a diverse 30-example sample (non-TUI, 20s timeout each) spanning bandit / bomber / attn / cache / cgsp / go / monopoly / ruliology / spectral domains — **30/30 PASS, 0 timeouts**.
- TUI examples (`bear_02_tui`, `bomber_02_tui`, `dungeon_01_tui`, `go_07_tui`, `monopoly_02_tui`, `sudoku_03_tui`, `tactical_06_tui`, `tactical_09_fog_tui`) were skipped — they block on the terminal and are not smoke-testable headless.
