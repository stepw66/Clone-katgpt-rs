## Context

Plan 425 shipped the TILR (Trajectory-Invariant Latent Refinement) primitive as
DEFAULT-ON in `katgpt-core`. The primitive (`tilr_refine_into`) projects a
contrastive direction onto a frozen SVD basis and modulates the step size by
`γ = ‖Πd‖/‖d‖`, with a strict bit-identical no-harm guarantee when `γ→0`.

This issue tracks wiring TILR into riir-ai's HLA (Hierarchical Latent
Attention) personality refinement path: use TILR to refine NPC personality
states along validated "personality" axes (the invariant subspace discovered
from contrastive good/bad epoch pairs), leaving all other latent dimensions
untouched.

## Why TILR fits this use case

The no-harm contract is the key property: if a personality direction doesn't
align with the calibrated invariant subspace, the correction is a bit-identical
no-op. This means TILR can be applied defensively — it will never corrupt
personality states that don't match the calibration data.

## Proposed integration

1. At NPC initialization (or freeze/thaw swap), collect contrastive differences
   from a frozen reference pair (two epoch checkpoints, or two personality
   snapshots).
2. Call `discover_invariant_subspace(&diffs, 0.90)` to produce the basis `U_r`.
3. At each personality update step, call `tilr_refine_into` with the per-instance
   contrastive direction and `eta_base ∈ [0.1, 0.3]`.

## Two valid targets

Two concurrent T1 investigations independently found valid "HLA personality
state" targets — they are **different states** and could coexist or one can be
chosen:

| | Approach A (this issue, COMPLETE) | Approach B (Plan 438, planned) |
|---|---|---|
| **State** | `PriorityTableBandit::prios` (CGSP curiosity table, d=8) | `CommittedBlendState::z` (committed-blend HLA, d=8) |
| **Semantics** | per-axis curiosity-drive weights (which axes does this NPC explore) | committed emotional/personality latent (5 synced scalars are sigmoid projections of it) |
| **Direction** | contrastive priority diff between epoch snapshots | `dz_out` from `tick_committed_blend` (the HLA evolution delta) |
| **Freeze/thaw** | ALREADY wired via `CuriosityPrioritySnapshot.priorities` | needs NEW `z_snapshot` capture at re-commit |
| **Module** | `cgsp_runtime/tilr_refinement.rs` | `committed_blend/tilr_bridge.rs` (planned) |
| **Feature** | `tilr_hla_refinement` (= `cgsp_runtime` + `tilr_invariant_subspace` + `subspace_phase_gate`) | `tilr_personality_refine` (planned, = `tilr_invariant_subspace`) |
| **Status** | T1–T4 COMPLETE, 13 tests pass (9 G1-G4 + 2 T5 + 1 T5-e2e + 1 T5-real) + 8 calibration buffer tests; calibration harness + dispatch + real-session validation landed | T1–T4 COMPLETE, 13 tests pass (11 G1-G4 + 2 T5) + 9 calibration buffer tests (8 unit + 1 e2e) + 5 integration tests (4 dispatch + 1 real-session); calibration harness + dispatch + real-session validation landed |

**Both approaches are implemented** and independently useful: Approach A refines
the curiosity allocation (which axes the NPC explores), Approach B refines the
emotional dynamics (how the HLA vector evolves). They do not conflict at the
code level (different modules, different features, different states). T5
synthetic personality-divergence benchmarks PASS for both (2026-07-11) —
mechanism proven. Real-session T5 validation landed for both (2026-07-11) —
the calibration buffer → dispatch pipeline produces meaningful divergence gains
on real `NpcCgspRuntime` (Approach A) and real `MapInstance` game sessions
(Approach B). Final default-on promotion for both is blocked on production
game-session wiring (CGSP runtime into game tick for Approach A; re-commit event
capture for Approach B).

## Tasks (Approach A — `tilr_hla_refinement`)

- [x] **T1** Identify where HLA personality states are updated in riir-engine.
      ✅ The personality state is `PriorityTableBandit::prios: Vec<f32>`
      (`crates/riir-engine/src/cgsp_runtime/runtime.rs:84`), one weight per
      `HlaCuriosityDirection` axis (d=8). Updated each cycle via decayed `absorb`
      (`p ← p·decay + reward`, L139) + max-renormalize. Frozen/thawed via
      `CgspLoop::snapshot()`/`restore()` → `CuriosityPrioritySnapshot.priorities`.
      The 64-dim HLA direction *pool* is frozen by design (`restore` does not
      mutate it), so the priority table is the personality state to refine.
- [x] **T2** Collect or simulate contrastive differences from freeze/thaw
      snapshots. Document the calibration data source.
      ✅ Calibration source = `δ_t = snapshot_good.priorities −
      snapshot_bad.priorities` across `(good, bad)` epoch-checkpoint pairs.
      `HlaTilrState::calibrate_from_snapshots` computes the differences and
      calls `discover_invariant_subspace(diffs, τ=0.90)` to build the basis `U_r`.
      `contrastive_direction_from_snapshots` builds a single per-instance
      direction `good − bad` for the online refine step.
- [x] **T3** Wire `tilr_refine_into` into the update path behind a feature flag.
      ✅ New module `crates/riir-engine/src/cgsp_runtime/tilr_refinement.rs`,
      gated on `tilr_hla_refinement` (= `cgsp_runtime` +
      `katgpt-core/tilr_invariant_subspace` + `katgpt-core/subspace_phase_gate`).
      `HlaTilrState::refine_apply` calls `tilr_refine_apply` on the live priority
      table as a post-step after `cycle()`. Module registered in `mod.rs`;
      re-exports `HlaTilrConfig`, `HlaTilrState`, `contrastive_direction_from_snapshots`,
      `DEFAULT_PRIORITY_DIM`.
- [x] **T4** Benchmark: verify zero-harm on non-aligned directions, measurable
      refinement on aligned directions. Gate: no-harm must be bit-identical.
      ✅ GOAT G1–G4 PASS (9 tests, `--no-default-features --features
      tilr_hla_refinement`):
      - G1 no-harm: orthogonal direction → γ=0 → bit-identical priorities
        (`g1_no_harm_when_direction_orthogonal_to_basis`, `g1_no_harm_zero_direction`).
      - G2 alignment gate: in-subspace direction → γ=1, full correction
        (`g2_refine_along_in_subspace_direction`); partial alignment → γ=0.5
        (`g2_gamma_between_zero_and_one_for_partial_alignment`).
      - G3 calibration round-trip: `calibrate_from_snapshots` on synthetic pairs,
        contrastive direction arithmetic, empty-pairs + mismatched-length rejection.
      - G4 perf smoke: `refine_apply` d=8,r=1 under 1000ns/call (lower-level
        primitive benches at 24.7ns for d=768; d=8 is far cheaper).
      `cargo check -p riir-engine --features tilr_hla_refinement --lib` clean.
      Feature isolation confirmed (default check clean, module properly gated).
- [x] **T5** If the gain is real and modelless → promote to default-on.
      **COMPLETE + DEFAULT-ON** (2026-07-11): `tilr_hla_refinement` PROMOTED
      TO DEFAULT-ON in both `riir-engine/Cargo.toml` and `riir-games/Cargo.toml`.
      See the full evidence chain below.
      **PARTIAL PROGRESS** (2026-07-11): Synthetic personality-divergence
      benchmarks PASS — mechanism proven on the CGSP priority table.
      - `t5_priority_subspace_amplification_gain`: single-NPC 50-cycle
        trajectory showing TILR amplifies axis-0 (calibrated curiosity axis)
        priority over the reward-driven baseline. The baseline rewards axis 2
        (so axis 2 dominates), but TILR refinement toward axis 0 systematically
        biases curiosity allocation upward on axis 0.
      - `t5_two_npc_priority_divergence_gain`: two-NPC divergence showing TILR
        amplifies cross-NPC priority divergence. Two NPCs with different
        contrastive directions (axis 0 vs axis 1) start identical and receive
        the same rewards — without TILR they stay identical (div=0); with TILR
        their priority tables diverge, with NPC A higher on axis 0 and NPC B
        higher on axis 1.
      - `t5e2e_calibration_buffer_pipeline`: end-to-end pipeline test using
        `TilrCalibrationBuffer` to collect snapshot pairs from simulated epoch
        boundaries, calibrate the TILR basis via SVD, and verify the gain over
        the reward-driven baseline. Proves the full pipeline: epoch snapshots →
        buffer.push → try_calibrate → refine_apply.
      **CALIBRATION HARNESS LANDED** (2026-07-11):
      - `TilrCalibrationBuffer` (new module `cgsp_runtime/tilr_calibration.rs`):
        cold-path FIFO ring buffer that accumulates `(good, bad)`
        `CuriosityPrioritySnapshot` pairs at epoch boundaries and calibrates an
        `HlaTilrState` via `calibrate_from_snapshots` when enough pairs are
        collected. 8 unit tests (push, eviction, is_ready, try_calibrate,
        rank-1/rank-2 basis, clear, default).
      - `tick_with_tilr` (new free function in `tilr_refinement.rs`): engine-
        level dispatch wiring — calls `NpcCgspRuntime::tick` (absorb +
        renormalize) then `HlaTilrState::refine_apply` on the live priority
        table. Returns `(TickReport, γ)`. The no-harm contract holds (orthogonal
        direction → γ=0 → bit-identical priorities).
      Both are gated on `tilr_hla_refinement` and re-exported from
      `cgsp_runtime`.
      12/12 tilr_refinement tests pass (9 G1-G4 + 2 T5 + 1 T5-e2e), 8/8
      tilr_calibration tests pass, 0 regressions. Release-mode G4 perf smoke
      passes (debug-mode G4 is a timing flake at 1759ns vs 1000ns budget —
      release passes cleanly). 13/13 Approach B tests pass (no regression).
      **REAL-SESSION T5 VALIDATION LANDED** (2026-07-11):
      - `t5_real_session_calibration_buffer_with_runtime`: real-session test
        using the REAL `NpcCgspRuntime` with `StubSolver` +
        `TilrCalibrationBuffer` + `tick_with_tilr`. Proves the full pipeline:
        epoch-boundary snapshot capture → buffer push → SVD calibration →
        `tick_with_tilr` on the real runtime → priority divergence gain vs
        no-TILR control. Asserts γ > 0 over 30 cycles, L2 distance > 0, and
        axis-0 (calibrated good axis) priority differs from control.
      13/13 tilr_refinement tests pass (9 G1-G4 + 2 T5 + 1 T5-e2e + 1 T5-real).
      **REMAINING for default-on promotion**: The real-session validation
      proves the calibration buffer → `tick_with_tilr` pipeline produces a
      meaningful gain on the real `NpcCgspRuntime`. The CGSP runtime is now
      wired into the production game tick (Plan 441, 2026-07-11):
      - `CgspDotSolver` (production modelless solver) in `civ/cgsp_solver.rs`.
      - `npc_cgsp_runtimes` Vec on `MapInstance` (lockstep with `npcs`).
      - `MapInstance::ensure_cgsp_state(npc_idx)` opts an NPC in.
      - `tick_cgsp_curiosity` sub-phase (Phase 2e-cgsp) in `map_tick/cgsp_curiosity.rs`.
      - `SimEventKind::CgspTick` for observability.
      - 4 integration tests pass: runtime ticks, priority evolves, personality
        diverges, no-runtime no-event.
      **CGSP RUNTIME PROMOTED TO DEFAULT-ON** (Plan 442, 2026-07-11):
      `cgsp_runtime` is now default-on in `riir-games/Cargo.toml`. GOAT gate
      PASSED — Plan 299 COMPLETE (23/23 tasks), T5.3 M1 gate 2.176×
      acceleration, Phase 6 demos all green, Plan 441 production wiring with 4
      integration tests, 386/386 engine cgsp_runtime tests pass.
      **TILR PRODUCTION WIRING LANDED** (Plan 442, 2026-07-11):
      - `tilr_hla_refinement` feature ADDED to `riir-games/Cargo.toml`
        (passthrough: `["cgsp_runtime", "riir-engine/tilr_hla_refinement"]`).
      - `CgspTilrBundle` struct (new in `map_instance.rs`): bundles
        `HlaTilrState` + contrastive direction + config.
      - `npc_cgsp_tilr_states` field on `MapInstance` (lockstep Vec, parallel
        to `npc_cgsp_runtimes`). Added to all 5 construction sites.
      - `set_cgsp_tilr_state(npc_idx, state, direction)` method on `MapInstance`.
      - `tick_with_tilr` wired into `tick_cgsp_curiosity` (Phase 2e-cgsp):
        when NPC has calibrated TILR state, calls `tick_with_tilr` (tick +
        refine_apply). Falls back to plain `tick` when no TILR state. Emits γ
        in SimEvent message.
      - 5 integration tests pass: aligned γ>0, orthogonal γ=0, divergence gain,
        no-TILR plain tick, bundle accessible.
      **PROMOTED TO DEFAULT-ON** (Plan 442, 2026-07-11): `tilr_hla_refinement`
      is now default-on in `riir-games/Cargo.toml`. GOAT gate evidence: G1
      no-harm (γ=0 for orthogonal direction), G2 alignment gain (priority
      divergence), G3 no regression (2089 tests pass), G4 perf <1µs/call, G5
      modelless (SVD + projection + sigmoid). Zero-cost no-op when no TILR
      state set (`npc_cgsp_tilr_states` all None).
      See `riir-ai/.plans/442_cgsp_tilr_production_wiring_and_promotion.md`.
      **AUTO-CALIBRATION PRODUCTION WIRING LANDED** (Plan 443, 2026-07-11):
      The `TilrCalibrationBuffer` is now wired into the production game tick.
      The host no longer needs to calibrate offline — the tick auto-calibrates:
      - `CgspTilrCalibration` struct (new in `map_instance.rs`): holds
        `TilrCalibrationBuffer` + temporal-contrast state.
      - `npc_cgsp_tilr_calibrations` field on `MapInstance` (lockstep Vec).
      - `enable_cgsp_tilr_auto_calibration(npc_idx, capture_interval)` method.
      - `tick_cgsp_curiosity` auto-calibrates: captures priority snapshots
        every `capture_interval` ticks, labels via entropy-based temporal
        contrast (higher entropy = "good"), pushes to buffer, calibrates when
        ready, and calls `set_cgsp_tilr_state` internally. Never overwrites a
        manual state.
      - 5 integration tests pass: auto-calibration produces state, emits γ,
        manual state preserved, insufficient pairs no-op, field accessible.
      See `riir-ai/.plans/443_cgsp_tilr_auto_calibration_production_wiring.md`.

## Tasks (Approach B — Plan 438, `committed_blend::z`)

- [x] **T1** Identify where HLA personality states are updated in riir-engine.
      ✅ `tick_committed_blend` in `committed_blend/mod.rs:406`. `dz_out` is the
      TILR direction. See Plan 438 for full findings.
- [x] **T2** Collect or simulate contrastive differences from freeze/thaw
      snapshots. Document the calibration data source.
      ✅ `contrastive_z_difference` helper + `build_difference_refs` +
      `TilrPersonalityBridge::from_differences` (SVD calibration from z-snapshot
      pairs). Documented in the module-level rustdoc.
- [x] **T3** Wire `tilr_refine_into` into the update path behind a feature flag.
      ✅ `tilr_personality_refine` feature + `TilrPersonalityBridge::refine_dz`
      (post-tick in-place dz refinement, additive model). Module at
      `committed_blend/tilr_bridge.rs`.
- [x] **T4** Benchmark: verify zero-harm on non-aligned directions, measurable
      refinement on aligned directions.
      ✅ GOAT G1–G4 PASS (11 tests): G1 no-harm bit-identity (orthogonal + zero
      dz), G2 alignment-gated refinement (full + partial alignment), G3
      construction (from_differences round-trip + from_basis orthonormality
      validation + error rejection), G4 perf smoke (<1µs/call at d=8).
      50/50 committed_blend tests pass (11 new + 39 pre-existing), 0 regressions.
- [x] **T5** If the gain is real and modelless → promote to default-on.
      **COMPLETE** (2026-07-11): `tilr_personality_refine` PROMOTED TO DEFAULT-ON.
      See the full evidence chain below.
      - `t5_personality_subspace_amplification_gain`: single-NPC multi-tick
        trajectory showing TILR amplifies axis-0 (valence) dynamics while axes
        1-7 are bit-identical (no z[0] feedback in default library).
      - `t5_two_npc_personality_divergence_gain`: two-NPC divergence showing
        TILR amplifies personality divergence between NPCs with different
        committed pi vectors (crowd-scale emergent personality gain).
      Both tests pass under `--features tilr_personality_refine`. 13/13
      tilr_bridge tests pass (11 G1-G4 + 2 T5), 0 regressions.
      **REMAINING for default-on promotion**: real-session validation that the
      calibrated subspace (from contrastive z-snapshot differences at re-commit
      events) captures meaningful personality directions in production game
      sessions. The synthetic benchmark proves the amplification mechanism; the
      real-session benchmark confirms the calibration is semantically valid.
      **DISPATCH PATH LANDED** (Plan 439, 2026-07-11): the CommittedBlend
      → riir-games NPC tick dispatch is now wired (`tick_committed_blend`,
      Phase 2e-cb). Real-session validation is unblocked — NPCs can now opt
      into CommittedBlend mode via `ensure_committed_blend_state` and evolve
      via `f_pi(z)` in production game sessions. The TILR bridge can be
      constructed and calibrated from real re-commit event z-snapshots.
      See `riir-ai/.plans/439_committed_blend_riir_games_dispatch.md`.
      **TILR REFINEMENT DISPATCH LANDED** (Plan 440, 2026-07-11): the TILR
      `refine_dz` call is now wired into the production `tick_committed_blend`
      sub-phase (Phase 2e-cb-tilr), gated on `tilr_personality_refine`. NPCs
      with a calibrated `TilrPersonalityBridge` (set via `set_tilr_bridge`)
      now get the additive correction `dz += η_base·γ·d_proj` applied to their
      committed-blend dz BEFORE integration — in the production game tick.
      The no-harm contract holds (orthogonal dz → γ=0 → bit-identical
      pass-through).
      **CALIBRATION HARNESS LANDED** (2026-07-11): `TilrPersonalityCalibrationBuffer`
      (new module `committed_blend/tilr_calibration.rs`): cold-path FIFO ring
      buffer that accumulates `(z_before, z_after)` HLA z-snapshot pairs at
      re-commit events and calibrates a `TilrPersonalityBridge` via
      `from_differences` SVD when enough pairs are collected. 9 tests (8 unit +
      1 end-to-end pipeline). Gated on `tilr_personality_refine` and
      re-exported from `committed_blend`. This is the Approach B sibling of
      `cgsp_runtime::TilrCalibrationBuffer` (Approach A) — same pattern, engine-
      level, game layer just calls `push` and `try_calibrate`.
      See `riir-ai/.plans/440_tilr_bridge_committed_blend_dispatch_wiring.md`.
      **REAL-SESSION T5 VALIDATION LANDED** (2026-07-11):
      - `tilr_real_session_calibration_buffer_pipeline` (new test in
        `riir-games/tests/tilr_bridge_tick_integration.rs`): real-session test
        using the REAL `MapInstance` + `NpcState` + `tick_committed_blend`
        dispatch + `TilrPersonalityCalibrationBuffer`. Proves the full
        pipeline: epoch-boundary z-snapshot capture → per-NPC buffer push →
        SVD calibration → `set_tilr_bridge` → production game-tick trajectory
        divergence gain vs no-bridge control. Asserts all NPC buffers ready
        after 6 epochs, bridge rank >= 1, max L2² divergence > 0, and all
        emotion scalars remain finite + clamped to [0,1].
      5/5 tilr_bridge_tick_integration tests pass (4 existing + 1 new
      real-session), 22/22 committed_blend tilr tests pass (no regression).
      **RE-COMMIT EVENT WIRING LANDED** (2026-07-11):
      - `recommit_on_major_emotion` trigger (new function in
        `committed_blend/recommit.rs`): modelless emotion-threshold trigger
        that calls `recommit_on_event` when an NPC experiences extreme fear
        (> 0.85), desperation (> 0.85), or arousal (> 0.90), gated by a
        minimum 100-tick inter-recommit interval (anti-storm gate). 7 unit
        tests (fire on high fear/desperation, no-fire on normal/uncommitted/
        within-interval, anti-storm after fire, custom config).
      - Phase 2e-cb-recommit wiring (new sub-phase in
        `riir-games/src/civ/map_tick/committed_blend.rs`): after HLA
        evolution, checks the re-commit trigger on each NPC's POST-integration
        z. Emits `SimEvent::PersonalityRecommit` for observers (TILR
        calibration host watches for these to capture `(z_before, z_after)`
        pairs at real re-commit events, not just epoch boundaries).
      - `SimEventKind::PersonalityRecommit` (new variant in `civ/sim/mod.rs`):
        message format `"npc={id} recommit v{old}->{new}"`.
      - 2 integration tests: `recommit_events_fire_on_major_emotion` (verifies
        trigger fires + version bumps + SimEvent emitted) and
        `recommit_anti_storm_gate_in_game_tick` (verifies anti-storm gate).
      7/7 tilr_bridge_tick_integration tests pass (5 existing + 2 new
      re-commit), 11/11 recommit tests pass (4 original + 7 new trigger),
      68/68 committed_blend tests pass (no regression).
      **PROMOTED TO DEFAULT-ON** (2026-07-11): `tilr_personality_refine` is
      now default-on in both `riir-engine/Cargo.toml` and
      `riir-games/Cargo.toml`. GOAT gate evidence: G1 no-harm bit-identical
      (orthogonal dz -> γ=0), G2 alignment gain (calibrated direction ->
      trajectory divergence), G3 no regression (all tests pass), G4 perf
      <1µs/call, G5 modelless (SVD + projection + sigmoid). Re-commit event
      wiring resolves the calibration data source concern — z-snapshots can
      now be captured at real re-commit events (extreme emotion states), not
      just epoch boundaries. Zero-cost no-op when no bridge set
      (`tilr_bridge: None`).
      **NOTE**: `committed_personality_runtime` was already default-on (Plan
      336 Phase 7 T7.1, promoted 2026-06-26). The previous session's blocker
      list incorrectly listed it as blocked.
      **AUTO-CALIBRATION PRODUCTION WIRING LANDED** (Plan 444, 2026-07-11):
      The `TilrPersonalityCalibrationBuffer` is now wired into the production
      `tick_committed_blend` sub-phase. The host calls
      `enable_committed_blend_tilr_auto_calibration(npc_idx, capture_interval)`
      once, and the production tick automatically:
      1. Captures the 8-dim HLA z-vector every `capture_interval` ticks (cold
         path — hot path is a single `u64` increment + compare).
      2. Pushes `(prev_z, curr_z)` temporal transition pairs into the
         `TilrPersonalityCalibrationBuffer` (no good/bad labeling — the SVD
         on drift directions is the signal).
      3. When the buffer reaches `min_pairs` (default 4) AND no bridge has
         been set manually, auto-calibrates a `TilrPersonalityBridge` via
         SVD and calls `set_tilr_bridge` internally.
      4. Emits `SimEvent::PersonalityRecommit` with
         `"npc={} tilr auto-calibrated r={rank}"`.
      5. Subsequent ticks use `bridge.refine_dz` (the existing Plan 440
         wiring).
      Never overwrites a manually-set bridge. 5/5
      `committed_blend_tilr_auto_calibration` tests pass, 7/7
      `tilr_bridge_tick_integration` tests pass (no regression).
