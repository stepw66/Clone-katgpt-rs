# Issue 002: ANE Concat-Tap Forward Kernels for Larger Models

**Source:** Research 223 — maderix/ANE Distillation
**Status:** CLOSED (deferred — blocked on multi-layer model integration)
**Priority:** Low

**Closure rationale (2026-06-20):** Issue explicitly self-defers. All four task items are blocked on multi-layer model integration (n_layer > 4), which is out of scope for the current 1-layer microGPT. The micro-benchmark showed only 2-3 dispatch savings at 1-layer scale — not worth the kernel complexity. Reopen when katgpt-rs supports multi-layer models.

## What

Modify ANE forward pass to use concat-tap pattern: output not just the result but also intermediate activations (Q, K, V, xnorm, etc.) in a single dispatch. Eliminates redundant ANE calls for backward pass and KV cache warm.

## Why

- maderix/ANE saves all intermediates in single ANE dispatch during forward
- Reduces ANE dispatch count by 2-3× per layer
- Critical for multi-layer models (12 layers × 3 saved dispatches = 36 fewer dispatches)

## Blocker

- Our microGPT is 1-layer — only saves 2-3 dispatches total
- Not worth the complexity for current scale

## When to Unblock

- When katgpt-rs supports multi-layer models (n_layer > 4)
- When KV cache warm needs saved intermediates

## Tasks

- [-] Extend MIL/kernel generation to concat outputs (deferred — blocked on multi-layer model)
- [-] Modify forward pass to extract and cache intermediates (deferred — blocked on multi-layer model)
- [-] Benchmark: single dispatch vs multiple dispatch for 12-layer model (deferred — blocked on multi-layer model)
- [-] Verify intermediate accuracy (cosine ≥ 0.999 vs separate computation) (deferred — blocked on multi-layer model)
