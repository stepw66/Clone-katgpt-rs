//! NFCoT FlowFold — Confidence-gated chain folding via flow scores (Plan 229 T7).
//!
//! Integrates NF FlowScore with ThoughtFold chain folding (Plan 195).
//! Before fold: compute flow_score(original_chain).
//! After fold: compute flow_score(folded_chain).
//! Accept fold if flow_score(folded) ≥ α · flow_score(original).
//!
//! This prevents ThoughtFold from folding away important reasoning steps.
//!
//! Requires: `nf_flow_score` + `chain_fold` features.
