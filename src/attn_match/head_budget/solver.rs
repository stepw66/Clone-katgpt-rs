//! Greedy-swap head budget solver (Plan 271 Phase 3, Algorithm 4).
//!
//! Given per-head sensitivity curves and a target overall ratio, find a
//! per-head share allocation that minimizes total quality loss. The greedy
//! swap algorithm is a coordinate-descent variant: repeatedly move a small
//! budget `η` from the head with the smallest marginal loss to the head with
//! the largest marginal gain, until no improving swap exists.
//!
//! # Algorithm (informal)
//! 1. Initialize each head with `target_ratio` (uniform per-head ratio).
//! 2. Repeat:
//!    - Find the head `g` with the largest `marginal_gain(r_g, η)`.
//!    - Find the head `l` with the largest `marginal_gain(r_l - η, η)` (i.e.,
//!      the head whose loss from giving up η is smallest — equivalently, the
//!      one whose curve is flattest at its current ratio).
//!    - If `gain_g > loss_l` (net improvement), transfer η from `l` to `g`.
//!    - Else stop.
//! 3. Return the final per-head ratios.
//!
//! # Convergence
//! Each improving swap strictly decreases total quality loss, and total loss
//! is bounded below by 0, so the algorithm terminates. Worst-case iteration
//! count is `O(num_heads / η)` but in practice far fewer.

/// Convergence threshold for the greedy swap: if the net quality gain from
/// the best swap is below this, stop. We use a larger threshold than
/// `STABILITY_EPS` (1e-12) because f32 interpolation rounding can produce
/// tiny spurious gains (~1e-7) when curves are symmetric.
