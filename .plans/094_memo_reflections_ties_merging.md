# Plan 094: MeMo Reflections + TIES Merging

> Distilled from [MeMo: Memory as a Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.15156) (Research 60)
> Two extractable techniques: Reflection QA pipeline (modelless) + TIES model merging (model-based)

## Verdict

MeMo validates our existing Raven RSM (O(1) retrieval) and G-Zero (multi-phase protocol) design. Two concrete techniques worth implementing:

1. **Reflection QA Pipeline** — 5-step data synthesis for generating compositional training data from game replays. Feature-gated for GOAT proof.
2. **TIES Model Merging** — Trim + sign-elect + disjoint merge at ρ=0.3 for combining domain LoRA adapters. Lives in riir-ai (requires trained adapters).

## Tasks

- [ ] T1: Add `memo_reflections` feature gate to `microgpt-rs/Cargo.toml`
- [ ] T2: Create `src/pruners/reflection.rs` with `ReflectionQA` struct and `synthesize_reflections()` skeleton
- [ ] T3: Implement Step 1 (Fact Extraction) — direct + indirect extraction from game state sequences
- [ ] T4: Implement Step 2 (Consolidation) — merge related facts into multi-fact questions
- [ ] T5: Implement Step 3 (Verification) — self-containment check + rewrite
- [ ] T6: Implement Step 4 (Entity Surfacing) — pattern-from-description QA pairs (reversal curse)
- [ ] T7: Implement Step 5 (Cross-Game Synthesis) — converging clues + parallel properties across game domains
- [ ] T8: Create `examples/bomber_13_reflection_qa.rs` — generate reflection QA from bomber replays
- [ ] T9: Create `examples/go_09_reflection_qa.rs` — generate reflection QA from Go replays
- [ ] T10: Add GOAT proof test in `tests/test_memo_reflections.rs`
- [ ] T11: Implement `ties_merge()` in `riir-ai/crates/riir-gpu/src/merging.rs` (or new crate)
- [ ] T12: Add `ties_merge` feature gate to riir-ai
- [ ] T13: Create merge benchmark example
- [ ] T14: Run clippy + tests, fix diagnostics
- [ ] T15: Update README.md (both repos) + research doc

## Context

### Why This Plan

MeMo (Research 58) proves that:
1. A trained memory model provides O(1) retrieval independent of corpus size
2. 5-step data synthesis generates compositional QA pairs that capture cross-document relationships
3. TIES merging at ρ=0.3 saves 33% compute at K=2 with manageable accuracy loss
4. Structured multi-turn protocols outperform single-turn and unstructured multi-turn

Our system already captures (1) via Raven RSM and (4) via G-Zero phases. The gaps are (2) and (3).

## Architecture

│ Step 1: Extract  │ ── direct: (state, action, outcome) → "What action at state S?"

#### Key Types

```rust
/// A reflection QA pair synthesized from game replay data.
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub struct ReflectionQA {
    /// The question (compositional, self-contained)
    pub question: String,
    /// The answer (factual, derived from game data)
    pub answer: String,
    /// Source step that generated this pair
    pub step: ReflectionStep,
    /// Game domain
    pub domain: ReflectionDomain,
    /// Number of game situations this pair consolidates
    pub consolidation_count: usize,
    /// Whether this pair passed self-containment verification
    pub verified: bool,
}

#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum ReflectionStep {
    DirectExtraction,
    IndirectExtraction,
    Consolidation,
    Verification,
    EntitySurfacing,
    CrossGameSynthesis,
}

#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum ReflectionDomain {
    Bomber,
    Go,
    FFT,
    CrossGame,
}

/// Synthesize reflection QA pairs from game state sequence.
pub fn synthesize_reflections(
    game_states: &[GameState],
    domain: ReflectionDomain,
) -> Vec<ReflectionQA> {
    let extracted = extract_facts(game_states, domain);
    let consolidated = consolidate_facts(&extracted);
    let verified = verify_self_containment(&consolidated);
    let surfaced = surface_entities(&verified, domain);
    let cross = synthesize_cross_game(&verified, &surfaced, domain);
    verified.into_iter().chain(surfaced).chain(cross).collect()
}
```

#### Why Modelless

Reflection QA pairs are consumed by `BanditPruner` and `AbsorbCompress` — same heuristic learning path. No gradient updates. The QA format provides denser training signal than raw (state, action) pairs because:
- Consolidated facts combine multiple game situations
- Verified facts are self-contained (no pronoun/ambiguous reference issues)
- Entity surfacing creates reverse lookup patterns
- Cross-game synthesis transfers knowledge between domains

### D2: TIES Model Merging (`ties_merge` feature gate in riir-ai)

                    ▼
           φ_merged = base + τ_merged
```

#### Key Function

```rust
/// TIES merging: Trim, Elect sign, Disjoint merge.
/// ρ controls sparsification density (0.3 = keep top 30%).
pub fn ties_merge(
    base: &LoRAWeights,
    task_vectors: &[TaskVector],
    density: f32, // ρ ∈ (0, 1], recommended 0.3
) -> LoRAWeights {
    // 1. Trim: keep only top-ρ fraction of largest-magnitude entries per task vector
    let trimmed: Vec<SparseVector> = task_vectors
        .iter()
        .map(|tv| tv.trim_top_fraction(density))
        .collect();

    // 2. Elect sign: at each coordinate, majority vote weighted by magnitude
    let elected_signs = elect_signs(&trimmed);

    // 3. Disjoint merge: only keep entries that agree with elected sign
    let merged = disjoint_merge(&trimmed, &elected_signs);

    // 4. Add to base
    base.add(&merged)
}
```

**Location:** `riir-ai/crates/riir-gpu/src/merging.rs` or new `riir-ai/crates/riir-merging/`

**Why in riir-ai:** Requires trained LoRA adapters from GPU training pipeline. `microgpt-rs` is inference-only.

## GOAT Proof Strategy

### Reflection QA GOAT

Prove that reflection QA pairs improve bandit learning over raw (state, action) pairs:

```
Control: Bandit trained on raw game replay data (existing Plan 092)
Treatment: Bandit trained on reflection QA pairs (this plan)
Metric: Win rate improvement after same number of episodes
```

**Pass criteria:**
- [ ] Reflection QA generates ≥100 compositional pairs from 100 rounds of game data
- [ ] ≥50% of pairs pass self-containment verification (Step 3)
- [ ] Cross-game synthesis produces ≥10 pairs connecting different game domains
- [ ] Bandit trained on reflections shows measurable win rate improvement vs raw replay

### TIES Merge GOAT

Prove that TIES merging at ρ=0.3 produces usable merged adapter:

```
1. Train 2 separate LoRA adapters (Bomber domain, Go domain)
2. Merge via TIES at ρ=0.3
3. Evaluate merged adapter on both domains
4. Compare vs individual adapters and vs zero-adapter baseline
```

**Pass criteria:**
- [ ] Merged adapter retains >70% of best individual adapter's quality per domain
- [ ] Compute saving ≥30% vs full retrain on union

## Files to Create

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `microgpt-rs/src/pruners/reflection.rs` | Reflection QA pipeline + types |
| `microgpt-rs/examples/bomber_13_reflection_qa.rs` | Bomber reflection QA demo |
| `microgpt-rs/examples/go_09_reflection_qa.rs` | Go reflection QA demo |
| `microgpt-rs/tests/test_memo_reflections.rs` | GOAT proof tests |
| `riir-ai/crates/riir-gpu/src/merging.rs` | TIES merge implementation |

## Files to Modify

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `microgpt-rs/Cargo.toml` | Add `memo_reflections` feature gate |
| `microgpt-rs/src/pruners/mod.rs` | Add `reflection` module (gated) |
| `microgpt-rs/src/lib.rs` | Add `reflection` module (gated) |
| `riir-ai/Cargo.toml` (relevant crate) | Add `ties_merge` feature gate |
| `microgpt-rs/README.md` | Add MeMo section |
| `riir-ai/README.md` | Add TIES merging section |

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Reflection QA too domain-specific | Start with Bomber (simplest game state); generalize via `ReflectionDomain` enum |
| TIES merge accuracy gap too large | Paper shows -11pp at K=2; acceptable for our use case since we still beat baselines |
| No trained LoRA adapters to merge yet | TIES merge is future-ready; implement API + test with synthetic adapters |
| Feature gate scope creep | `memo_reflections` is modelless only; `ties_merge` stays in riir-ai |

## Priority

**Low-medium.** Both techniques are validated by the paper but our existing architecture already captures the core ideas (O(1) retrieval, multi-phase learning). The reflection QA pipeline could improve bandit training data quality, but the marginal gain over raw game replays is uncertain.

**Recommendation:** Implement T1–T3 (feature gate + skeleton + fact extraction) as proof-of-concept. Evaluate before implementing T4–T9. TIES merging (T11–T13) deferred until we have multiple trained LoRA adapters to merge.
