# 017: Hierarchical Tactical AI — DDTree + A* + State Machine

## Overview
Design and implement a **two-level AI architecture** for grid-based tactical puzzles
that scales to real game maps (16×16+). The DDTree becomes the **strategic brain**
(choosing *what* targets to visit in what order) while A* becomes the **tactical legs**
(choosing *how* to get there). A state machine handles execution, and a re-evaluation
loop handles dynamic situations.

This is the same pattern used by Into the Breach, Final Fantasy Tactics, and similar
tactical games.

## Architecture

## Key Insight: Tokens as Targets

The DDTree operates on **target indices**, not movement directions:

```
vocab_size = num_monsters + num_treasures + 1 (goal)

Token 0      = "Go kill Monster 0"     → A* → {→,→,↓,↓} → Attack
Token 1      = "Go kill Monster 1"     → A* → {←,←,↓}    → Attack
Token 2      = "Go collect Treasure 0" → A* → {→,↑,→}
Token 3      = "Go to Goal"            → A* → {↓,↓,→,→}

DDTree lookahead = num_targets ≤ 8
Each token expands to 10-20 step A* path
Total solution: 50-100+ steps, but DDTree only sees 8 strategic decisions
```

## Target System

```rust
enum Target {
    Monster(usize),    // "Go kill monster i"
    Treasure(usize),   // "Go collect treasure j"
    Goal,              // "Go to exit"
}

// Derived from map at parse time:
// targets[0] = Monster(0) at (2, 3)
// targets[1] = Monster(1) at (7, 5)
// targets[2] = Treasure(0) at (1, 7)
// targets[3] = Treasure(1) at (9, 3)
// targets[4] = Goal at (14, 14)
```

## StrategicPruner (ConstraintPruner for target selection)

Validates strategic-level decisions:

```
is_valid(depth, target_idx, parent_targets):
  target = targets[target_idx]

  match target:
    Monster(i):
      - Not already killed ✓
      - Reachable from current position ✓ (A* check)

    Treasure(j):
      - Not already collected ✓
      - Has inventory item ✓ (from killing a monster earlier)
      - No live monster on same tile ✓
      - Reachable ✓

    Goal:
      - All treasures collected ✓
      - Reachable ✓

  // Also check: target not already visited in parent_tokens
```

## Cost Model (for marginals / scoring)

Each target gets a cost/weight for the DDTree marginals:

```rust
fn target_cost(from: Pos, target: Target, state: &GameState) -> Cost {
    let distance = astar_distance(from, target.pos, state);
    let action_cost = match target {
        Monster(_) => distance + 1,  // +1 for attack action
        Treasure(_) => distance,     // auto-collect on arrival
        Goal => distance,
    };
    let urgency = match target {
        Monster(_) if inventory == 0 => HIGH,    // need item!
        Treasure(_) if inventory > 0 => HIGH,     // use item before waste
        Goal if all_collected => CRITICAL,
        _ => NORMAL,
    };
    Cost { steps: action_cost, urgency }
}

// Marginals: closer + more urgent targets get higher probability
// DDTree explores best strategic sequences first
```

### Terrain Cost Model (implemented in plan 018)

```
Terrain  Char  Cost  Emoji
Grass    .     1     ⬜
Sand     ~     2     🟨
Water    w     3     🟦
Wall     #     ∞     🧱
```

- `GameState.total_cost` tracks accumulated movement cost
- A* uses terrain-weighted g-score: `g = current.g + terrain_cost(grid, nr, nc)`
- `TacticalPruner.terrain_cost(r, c)` returns per-tile cost
- Animation speed scales with cost: 150ms × cost per step

## A* Pathfinder

```rust
fn find_path(
    grid: &[Vec<char>],
    from: (usize, usize),
    to: (usize, usize),
    blocked: &HashSet<(usize, usize)>,  // live monster positions
) -> Option<Vec<usize>>  // action sequence (0=Up, 1=Down, 2=Left, 3=Right)
```

- A* with Manhattan distance heuristic
- Terrain-weighted g-score (from plan 018)
- Considers walls (#) and live monster positions as obstacles
- Returns `None` if unreachable
- State-independent: only depends on grid layout and blocking set

## State Machine

```
States:
  Idle       → waiting for command
  Moving     → following A* path, one step per tick
  Arrived    → reached target position
  Attacking  → performing attack action on monster
  Collecting → performing collect action on treasure
  Evaluating → re-running strategic layer

Transitions:
  Idle       → Moving      (new target assigned)
  Moving     → Moving      (next step along path)
  Moving     → Arrived     (reached target pos)
  Arrived    → Attacking   (target is monster)
  Arrived    → Collecting  (target is treasure with item)
  Arrived    → Idle        (target is goal, done!)
  Attacking  → Evaluating  (monster killed, re-plan)
  Collecting → Evaluating  (treasure collected, re-plan)
  Evaluating → Idle        (new plan ready)
```

## Re-evaluation Loop

After completing each target:
1. Update `GameState` (position, inventory, killed, collected, dropped)
2. Re-compute A* distances to remaining targets (some may now be reachable/unreachable)
3. Build new marginals based on updated costs
4. Re-run DDTree with StrategicPruner using updated state
5. Feed next target to state machine

This handles:
- Monster killed → its tile no longer blocks A*
- Item picked up → treasures now unlockable
- Dynamic priorities → closer targets may become better choices

- Monsters (M): (4,2), (10,8), (15,5) = 3
- Treasures (T): (3,11), (10,2), (15,13) = 3
- Goal (G): (8,14)
- Bear (B): (1,1)
- Strategic tokens: 3M + 3T + 1G = 7 targets
- DDTree lookahead = 7 → fits u128/16 ✓

## Actual Results (Phase 3)

- **125 action steps** solved in **~68ms**
- Strategic layer: DDTree explores 7 target tokens → finds valid visit order
- Tactical layer: A* expands each target into 15-30 step paths
- All 3 monsters killed, all 3 treasures collected, bear at goal
- All assertions pass ✅
- 260 tests pass (80 lib + 180 pathfinder)

## Benchmark Results (Phase 5)

| Map | Approach | Nodes | Time | Steps | Solved |
|-----|----------|-------|------|-------|--------|
| Small (2×3) | Brute-force | 269 | 2.1ms | 7 | ✅ |
| Small (2×3) | Strategic | 4 | 160µs | 7 | ✅ |
| Original (17×16) | Strategic | 63 | 69.7ms | 125 | ✅ |
| Original (17×16) | Brute-force | — | N/A | — | ❌ infeasible |
| Arena (16×16) | Strategic | 662 | 670.5ms | 67 | ✅ |
| Corridor (16×16) | Strategic | 613 | 416.3ms | 59 | ✅ |

**Key insight**: Brute-force DDTree (vocab=5) max lookahead=8 (u128/16). Only works for ≤8 step puzzles.
Strategic DDTree (vocab=N targets) scales to any map size — A* handles the movement expansion.

## Design Decisions

1. **Keep TacticalPruner as game rules engine** — terrain costs added in 018
2. **StrategicPruner wraps TacticalPruner** — reuses game state logic at macro level
3. **A* is stateless function** — takes grid + blockers, returns path. No mutation.
4. **Re-evaluation is lightweight** — only re-solve remaining targets, not full plan
5. **State machine is simple** — just tracks execution phase, no complex logic
6. **Examples are self-contained** — StrategicPruner defined per-example

## Relationship to Plan 018

Plan 018 (Animated TUI with Movement Costs) contributed:
- `GameState.total_cost` field + accumulation in `apply_action`
- `TacticalPruner.terrain_cost(r, c)` function
- `pathfinder::terrain_cost()` + weighted A* g-score
- Animation primitives (AnimState, tick, interpolation) in `blue_bear_tui.rs`
- Terrain emoji: ⬜ grass, 🟨 sand, 🟦 water

Phase 4 reuses these primitives for the 16×16 dungeon TUI.

## Why This Architecture Works for Real Games

1. **Scalable**: 100×100 map? A* handles it. 20 targets? DDTree handles it.
2. **Dynamic**: Re-evaluation handles changing situations (new enemies, blocked paths)
3. **Extensible**: Add new target types (NPC, door, switch) without changing architecture
4. **Testable**: Each layer tested independently (A*, StrategicPruner, State Machine)
5. **Debuggable**: Can inspect strategic plan, A* paths, and execution separately
6. **Performant**: DDTree only sees 8 strategic tokens, not 100+ movement steps

## Precedent: How This Maps to Existing Sudoku System

| Sudoku | Tactical AI |
|--------|-------------|
| Token = digit (1-9) | Token = target index (0..N) |
| Depth = empty cell position | Depth = visit order position |
| Pruner = row/col/box conflict | Pruner = inventory/goal/reachability |
| Uniform marginals = BFS | Distance-weighted marginals = A*-guided |
| One cell at a time | One target at a time |
| Solution = filled grid | Solution = target visit order + paths |
