# Plan 282: Reachable Dual-Pool Memory Router (Modelless)

**Date:** 2026-06-16
**Research:** [katgpt-rs/.research/249_DecentMem_DualPool_Reachable_Router.md](../.research/249_DecentMem_DualPool_Reachable_Router.md)
**Source paper:** [arXiv:2605.22721](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2605.22721) — Hao, Long, Zhao 2026, "Self-Evolving MAS via Decentralized Memory"
**Target:** `crates/katgpt-core/src/cgsp/dual_pool.rs` (new module) + Cargo feature `cgsp_dual_pool`
**Status:** Active — Phase 4 complete (G3 E-pool growth + G4 faithfulness gate); Phase 5 (G5 CGSP integration) deferred to riir-ai; Phase 6 (docs + GOAT decision) complete — feature stays opt-in (G1–G4 PASS, G5 deferred)

---

## Goal

Ship a generic **dual-pool memory router** that splits a bandit's candidate pool into an exploitation pool (consolidated past successes, grows over time) and an exploration pool (fresh candidates, regenerated per cycle). The router uses sigmoid-based routing with provable **global reachability** (X-pool always has nonzero probability → Markov chain irreducible + aperiodic, DecentMem Theorem 1) and **O(log T) cumulative regret** (DecentMem Theorem 2). This extends the existing single-pool CGSP `HintDeltaBandit` — single-pool is the degenerate case `α = 1`.

**GOAT gate:** `cgsp_dual_pool` is opt-in. Promote to consideration for CGSP default only after benchmarks show (G1) proactive non-trapping beats CGSP's reactive collapse recovery, (G2) O(log T) regret verified on synthetic bandit, (G3) E-pool growth produces strategies the static pool misses, (G4) FaithfulnessProbe-consolidated items are not dead weight.

---

## Phase 1 — Unblocking Skeleton (CORE)

### Tasks

- [x] **T1.1** Define `PoolId` enum (`Exploitation = 0`, `Exploration = 1`) with `#[repr(u8)]` in `crates/katgpt-core/src/cgsp/dual_pool.rs`. Zero-cost tag.
- [x] **T1.2** Define `ReachableDualPoolRouter` trait (associated types `Item`, `Reward: Copy`; methods `route_select`, `route_update`, `consolidate`, `exploitation_probability`, `is_reachable`). Doc-comment cites DecentMem Theorems 1 + 2.
- [x] **T1.3** Implement `DualPoolBandit<B: HintDeltaBandit>` struct:
  - Fields: `e_pool: B` (exploitation — wraps existing HintDeltaBandit), `x_pool: B` (exploration), `w_e: f32` (exploitation weight, init 1.0), `w_x: f32` (exploration weight, fixed 1.0 per paper Eq. 6/7), `alpha_update_gain: f32` (paper's `α = 0.5`), `decay: f32` (paper's `β = 0.5`).
  - `exploitation_probability()` → `sigmoid(self.w_e - self.w_x).clamp(ε, 1−ε)` (NOT ratio — per AGENTS.md sigmoid rule; regret proof transfers per Research 249 §2.3). **Note:** f32 sigmoid saturates at `x ≳ 18` (1+exp(−18) rounds to 1.0 in f32), so raw sigmoid gives α=1.0 exactly at extreme weights — breaking `is_reachable()`. Added `min_exploration_prob` clamp (default `1e-4`) as the numerical reachability guarantee. The paper's continuous-math theorem holds; the clamp makes it hold in f32.
  - `route_select()` → sample pool by `exploitation_probability()`, select item from chosen pool's bandit (pure `sample_arm_from` fn avoids borrow conflict).
  - `route_update(pool, reward)` → DecentMem Eq. 6/7 (4-case match, only `w_e` updates; `w_x` fixed at 1.0).
  - `consolidate()` → Phase 1 priority-blend (same-size pools): `e[i] = blend·e[i] + (1−blend)·x[i]`, X-pool reset to uniform. True arm growth deferred to Phase 4.
  - `is_reachable()` → `exploitation_probability() < 1.0` (always true via clamp — reachability by construction in f32).
  - Implements `HintDeltaBandit` by delegating to the **active** pool (one pool per cycle, selected in `begin_cycle()`). Drops into `CgspLoop` as the `B` type parameter with zero loop changes.
- [x] **T1.4** Unit tests (10 tests, all pass):
  - `t14_sigmoid_routing_in_unit_interval`: α ∈ (0, 1) for default, extreme-high, and extreme-low w_e.
  - `t14_x_pool_always_reachable`: extreme w_e → `is_reachable()` true + α < 1.0; moderate w_e → X-pool selected ~12% of trials.
  - `t14_weight_update_e_pool_success`: E + success → w_e += gain.
  - `t14_weight_update_e_pool_fail`: E + fail → w_e decays, floors at 1.0.
  - `t14_weight_update_x_pool_success`: X + success → w_e decays.
  - `t14_consolidate_merges_x_into_e`: E-pool blended, size unchanged, X-pool reset to uniform.
  - Bonus: `route_select_returns_valid_arm_and_pool`, `hintdeltabandit_delegates_to_active_pool`, `begin_end_cycle_drives_routing`, `single_pool_degenerate_case_alpha_one`.
- [x] **T1.5** CgspLoop integration (minimal — Phase 1 skeleton): `DualPoolBandit<B>` implements `HintDeltaBandit`, so it drops into `CgspLoop` as `B` with zero changes to `cycle()`. Caller wraps `begin_cycle()` / `end_cycle()` around the existing cycle call. No `DualPoolMode` config variant needed for Phase 1 — the router is self-contained. Full automated `cycle_dual_pool` method deferred to Phase 5 (CGSP Integration Benchmark).
- [x] **T1.6** Register module + feature flag:
  - `#[cfg(feature = "cgsp_dual_pool")] pub mod dual_pool;` in `crates/katgpt-core/src/cgsp/mod.rs` ✓
  - Re-exports: `DualPoolBandit, DualPoolConfig, PoolId, ReachableDualPoolRouter` in `mod.rs` + `lib.rs` ✓
  - `cgsp_dual_pool = ["cgsp"]` in `crates/katgpt-core/Cargo.toml` ✓
  - `cgsp_dual_pool = ["katgpt-core/cgsp_dual_pool", "cgsp"]` passthrough in root `katgpt-rs/Cargo.toml` ✓
- [x] **T1.7** Validation: `cargo test -p katgpt-core --features cgsp_dual_pool --lib cgsp::dual_pool --release` → **10 passed, 0 failed**. `cargo check -p katgpt-core --lib --release` (default) → **clean**. `cargo check --features cgsp_dual_pool --release` (root) → **clean**.

**Phase 1 exit:** `ReachableDualPoolRouter` trait + `DualPoolBandit` impl compile and pass unit tests. Existing CGSP single-pool behavior unchanged.

---

## Phase 2 — Reachability Guarantee Proof (G1)

### Tasks

- [x] **T2.1** `g1_proactive_non_trapping` test:
  - Build `DualPoolBandit` with 8-arm E-pool + 8-arm X-pool.
  - Force E-pool to one-hot (arm 0 only) via `VecBandit::one_hot(8, 0)`.
  - **Without** any collapse detector (no `EntropyCollapse::inject_exploration`), verify that over the next 100 cycles, the router selects the X-pool at least once (sigmoid `1 - α > 0` guarantees this).
  - Compare: single-pool CGSP without collapse detector stays trapped indefinitely — verified: 100/100 draws select arm 0, mass_at_zero > 0.99.
  - Bonus: `g1_reachable_at_extreme_exploitation` — drives w_e to 500+ (α clamped to 1−ε), verifies X-pool still selected within 50,000 cycles (P ≥ 0.993).
- [x] **T2.2** `g1_reachability_vs_collapse_recovery` benchmark (`benches/dual_pool_reachability_bench.rs`):
  - Same one-hot trap setup. 500 trials, max 200k cycles.
  - **Dual-pool** (proactive, no detector): mean cycles-to-escape — balanced α≈0.5: 1.1; exploit-heavy α≈0.98: 55; extreme α≈1−ε: 10,320. **Always escapes** (max 79,264 < 200k cap).
  - **Single-pool + detector** (reactive): escapes in **1 cycle** once entropy < τ trips (zero overhead until collapse).
  - **Single-pool, no detector** (baseline failure): ∞ — 129/500 trials never escaped in 200k cycles (permanent trap).
  - **Per-cycle overhead**: dual-pool `begin_cycle()` = **0.5 ns/cycle** vs single-pool entropy check = **15.1 ns/cycle**. Dual-pool is **30× cheaper** per cycle (sigmoid+RNG vs N-log entropy compute) AND provides the formal reachability guarantee.
  - Documented tradeoff: dual-pool = constant nonzero exploration overhead every cycle (≥ `min_exploration_prob`); single-pool+detector = zero overhead until collapse, then 1-cycle recovery.
- [x] **T2.3** `g1_markov_chain_irreducibility` property test:
  - Build transition matrix `M[i][j] = α·T_E[j] + (1-α)·T_X[j]` from the dual-pool's effective transition probabilities.
  - Assert all entries of `M` are strictly positive (Theorem 1) — verified at 3 regimes (balanced, exploit-heavy, extreme).
  - Assert rows sum to 1 (valid stochastic matrix).
  - Assert `M` is irreducible (all entries > 0 → strongly connected) and aperiodic (self-loops exist).
  - Verified worst-case entry ≥ `(1−α)/n_arms` (X-pool teleportation floor).

**Phase 2 exit:** G1 passes — dual-pool provably never traps, by construction (sigmoid + clamp), without needing a reactive collapse detector. **30× lower per-cycle overhead** than the reactive entropy-based detector.

---

## Phase 3 — Regret Bound Proof (G2)

### Tasks

- [x] **T3.1** `g2_log_regret_synthetic` test:
  - Reward model: **E-pool staleness** — `r(α) = p_x + (p_e − p_x)·α − δ·α²` (concave parabola, NOT static rewards). E-pool reward is `p_e` when previous cycle was X-pool (fresh), `p_e − δ` when previous was E-pool (stale). This is the setting DecentMem Theorem 2 requires (strict concavity with interior maximizer `α* ∈ (0.5, 1)`).
  - Parameters: `p_e=0.7, p_x=0.5, δ=0.15` → `α* = 0.2/0.3 ≈ 0.667`, `r(α*) ≈ 0.567`.
  - Run 10,000 cycles. Track cumulative regret vs `r(α*)`.
  - **Result (sigmoid):** equilibrium `α_eq = 0.653` (diff from `α* = 0.013`), regret = 24.6 ≤ `5·log(T) = 46`. ✓
  - **Result (DualPoolBandit production code):** `α_eq = 0.654` (diff = 0.013), regret = 20.0 ≤ 46. ✓
  - **IMPORTANT FINDING:** The production code uses CONSTANT step size (gain=0.5, decay=0.5), not the vanishing step size `(1/ℓ)` that the paper's Robbins-Monro SA theory requires for true asymptotic O(log T). With constant step size, the router reaches a STABLE EQUILIBRIUM `α_eq ≈ α*` (not convergence), and the per-cycle regret gap `r(α*) − r(α_eq) ≈ 0.002` is tiny. For practical T (≤ ~50k), total regret ≤ C·log(T). Asymptotically, regret is Θ(T·gap) — technically linear, but with such a small constant that it looks logarithmic for all practical horizons. True O(log T) requires implementing vanishing step size (documented as future work).
- [x] **T3.2** `g2_fixed_routing_suboptimal` test (Corollary 1 — reversed):
  - Same staleness setup. Compare online router vs fixed `α = 0.5` vs fixed `α = 0.99` (≈ pure exploit).
  - **Results:**
    | Strategy | α_eq | Regret vs α* | Total Reward |
    |----------|------|-------------|-------------|
    | Online sigmoid | 0.653 | 24.6 | 5693 |
    | Fixed α=0.5 | 0.500 | 43.5 | 5655 |
    | Fixed α=0.99 | 0.990 | 155.2 | 5568 |
  - Online beats fixed-0.5 by 43% regret (5693 > 5655 reward) and fixed-0.99 by 84% regret (5693 > 5568 reward). ✓
  - Sanity: fixed-0.5 (closer to α*) has much smaller regret than fixed-0.99 (far from α*). Validates concavity. ✓
  - Note: the margin against fixed-0.5 is modest because `r(α)` is flat near the peak (`r(0.5)=0.5625` vs `r(0.667)=0.567`). The bigger win is against pure-exploit `α=1.0` where staleness penalty makes `r(1.0)=0.55` — matching the paper's ablation (§7.3) where online beats exploit-only by ~3% accuracy.
- [x] **T3.3** `g2_sigmoid_vs_ratio_routing` test:
  - Run both `α = sigmoid(w_e − w_x)` and `α = w_e / (w_e + w_x)` on the same staleness bandit (same RNG seed).
  - **Results:** sigmoid `α_eq = 0.653` (diff 0.013), ratio `α_eq = 0.614` (diff 0.053). Both within 0.20 of `α* = 0.667`. Both within 0.15 of each other. Regret within 2× (sigmoid 24.6, ratio 18.2 — ratio slightly lower due to RNG path, not a systematic difference). ✓
  - Validates Research 249 §2.3: sigmoid preserves the concavity structure, so the equilibrium transfer holds.

**Phase 3 exit:** G2 passes (practical property) — the online router adapts to the concave reward landscape, reaches `α_eq ≈ α*` (diff ≈ 0.013), and beats both fixed extremes. Regret ≤ C·log(T) for practical T. **Caveat:** true asymptotic O(log T) requires vanishing step size (future work). With constant step size, regret is Θ(T·0.002) — technically linear but practically logarithmic.

**Cross-references updated:** Research 249 §6 documents the constant-vs-vanishing step size finding. The `g2_log_regret_synthetic` test comment block explains the reward model and limitation.

## Phase 4 — E-Pool Growth + Faithfulness Gate (G3, G4)

### Tasks

- [x] **T4.1** `g3_epool_grows` test:
  - Start with 1-arm E-pool (minimal, practically empty), 16-arm X-pool.
  - Run 100 cycles. After each cycle, consolidate (rewarded X-pool items → E-pool).
  - Assert: E-pool size monotonically increases (or stays same if no rewards); E-pool ≥ 1 item after 100 cycles on a bandit with any positive-reward arm.
  - **DONE (2026-06-16):** Test passes. E-pool grows monotonically from 1 → 4+ arms over 100 cycles (rewarding X-pool arms 0, 5, 10 each cycle). Promotion threshold 0.05 — 3 distinct arms promoted.
- [x] **T4.2** `g3_growing_pool_discovers_new_strategies` test:
  - Scenario: E-pool initialized with 4 "known" directions. X-pool generates from a 16-direction superset.
  - The optimal direction is NOT in the initial E-pool (only in X-pool's superset).
  - Run 500 cycles. Assert: the optimal direction gets consolidated into E-pool (the NPC discovers a strategy beyond its initial template — the capability gap identified in Research 249 §2.1).
  - Compare: single-pool CGSP (static 4-direction pool) can never select the optimal direction (it's not in the pool). This is the GOAT gain.
  - **DONE (2026-06-16):** Test passes (50 cycles). E-pool grows from 4 → 5+ arms. X-pool arm 7 ("optimal direction") promoted into E-pool via `push_arm`. Verified: max E-pool priority > initial uniform(4) = 0.25, confirming the promoted direction carries elevated priority.
- [x] **T4.3** Wire `FaithfulnessProbe` (Plan 278) as consolidation gate:
  - Before consolidating an X-pool item into E-pool, run a causal intervention probe.
  - Only items with behavioral delta > `τ_faith` (configurable) enter E-pool.
  - This prevents Research 244's "dead condensed memory" failure — items the consumer structurally ignores don't clog the E-pool.
  - **DONE (2026-06-16):** Added `consolidate_growing_gated<F: Fn(usize) -> bool>(gate)` method. The gate closure wraps a `FaithfulnessProbe::is_faithfully_used(threshold)` check — arms that fail the probe (dead items) are rejected from promotion. Zero-cost when inlined, no heap alloc. The `consolidate_growing()` method delegates to `consolidate_growing_gated(|_| true)` (no gate).
- [x] **T4.4** `g4_faithfulness_gate_rejects_dead_items` test:
  - Construct an X-pool item that the consumer (Solver) structurally ignores (perturbation produces no behavioral delta).
  - Run consolidation with faithfulness gate ON.
  - Assert: dead item is rejected (not in E-pool after consolidate).
  - Run consolidation with gate OFF.
  - Assert: dead item enters E-pool (baseline failure mode — E-pool fills with dead weight).
  - **DONE (2026-06-16):** Test passes. Gate ON: E-pool grows 1→5 (4 live arms, 4 dead filtered). Gate OFF: E-pool grows 1→9 (all 8 arms promoted, dead weight clogs). Also verified `FaithfulnessProbe` correctly identifies faithful arms via `DotProductConsumer` + `faithfulness_profile().is_faithfully_used(threshold)`.

**Phase 4 exit:** G3 + G4 PASS — E-pool grows, discovers strategies beyond initial pool (G3), and faithfulness gate rejects dead items (G4). The `HintDeltaBandit` trait gained backward-compatible `push_arm()` + `is_growing()` default methods to support arm growth generically. `consolidate_growing_gated(gate)` is the FaithfulnessProbe integration point.

---

## Phase 5 — CGSP Integration Benchmark (G5)

### Tasks

- [ ] **T5.1** Integrate `DualPoolBandit` into `NpcCgspRuntime` (riir-ai, behind `cgsp_dual_pool` feature):
  - Each NPC's `PriorityTableBandit` wraps in `DualPoolBandit`.
  - E-pool = faction-template directions (frozen at spawn, as today).
  - X-pool = dynamically conjectured directions (the `CuriosityConjecturer` trait already supports this — the shipped impl uses a fixed pool, but the trait can generate novel directions).
  - Consolidation: rewarded X-pool directions → E-pool, with FaithfulnessProbe gate.
- [ ] **T5.2** `g5_personality_divergence_widens` benchmark:
  - Two same-faction NPCs, same RNG seed, 1000 cycles.
  - Measure priority-table cosine similarity over time.
  - Dual-pool: NPCs diverge MORE than single-pool (X-pool conjectures different novel directions per NPC → E-pools diverge).
  - Target: dual-pool cosine similarity < single-pool cosine similarity at cycle 1000.
- [ ] **T5.3** `g5_latency_budget` benchmark:
  - Dual-pool adds: 1 sigmoid + 1 branch + consolidation scan per cycle.
  - Assert: per-cycle overhead < 0.5µs over single-pool CGSP baseline (plasma tier).
  - No allocation in hot path (reuse pre-allocated pools).
- [ ] **T5.4** `g5_epool_persistence` test:
  - After 1000 cycles, snapshot the grown E-pool via existing `CuriosityPrioritySnapshot` + BLAKE3 + chain quorum (Plan 299 T4.6 infrastructure).
  - Reload snapshot. Assert: E-pool items are bit-identical (deterministic replay preserved).

**Phase 5 exit:** G5 passes — dual-pool CGSP shows wider personality divergence, stays in plasma latency budget, snapshots persist correctly.

---

## Phase 6 — Documentation + Promotion Decision

### Tasks

- [x] **T6.1** Add `dual_pool.rs` module docs citing DecentMem Theorems 1 + 2, sigmoid routing rationale, and the CGSP single-pool-as-degenerate-case relationship.
  - **DONE (2026-06-16):** Module header docs updated. "Phase 1 scope" section rewritten as "Phase coverage" reflecting Phase 1 (shipped) + Phase 4 (shipped) + Phase 5 (deferred to riir-ai). TL;DR extended with Phase 4 growth + FaithfulnessProbe gate note.
- [x] **T6.2** Update `katgpt-rs/.docs/07_adaptation.md` with dual-pool as CGSP extension.
  - **DONE (2026-06-16):** Added Technique 17 (Dual-Pool Reachable Memory Router) with full Problem/Solution/Implementation/Phase 4 growth/sigmoid-vs-ratio/proactive-vs-reactive/GOAT gate status/Performance sections. Technique count updated 16→17. Interaction Matrix updated with dual-pool row.
- [x] **T6.3** Update `katgpt-rs/README.md` Feature Showcase with dual-pool entry (after GOAT gate passes).
  - **DONE (2026-06-16):** Added "🔀 Dual-Pool Reachable Memory Router" showcase entry after temporal_deriv. Includes mermaid flow diagram (begin_cycle → sigmoid routing → E/X pool → cycle → consolidate → blend/grow/gate), GOAT G1–G4 PASS table (G5 deferred), key findings (proactive vs reactive, backward-compatible trait extension, sigmoid convention, FaithfulnessProbe fusion, CGSP = degenerate case).
- [x] **T6.4** Add example: `examples/cgsp_dual_pool_demo.rs` showing growing E-pool + X-pool exploration on a synthetic 8-direction pool.
  - **DONE (2026-06-16):** Example created with 3 demos: (1) G1 proactive reachability — drives w_E to 25000+, verifies X-pool still selected; (2) G3 E-pool growth — rewards X-pool arm 7, consolidates once, E-pool grows 4→5; (3) G4 faithfulness gate — gate ON promotes 4 live arms (E-pool 1→5), gate OFF promotes all 8 (E-pool 1→9). All assertions pass. Registered in Cargo.toml under `cgsp_dual_pool` feature. Also added `set_active_pool(PoolId)` public method to `DualPoolBandit` for deterministic replay/testing, and dual_pool re-exports to root `src/cgsp.rs` shim.
- [x] **T6.5** GOAT gate decision:
  - If G1–G5 all pass AND dual-pool shows measurably wider personality divergence (G5.2) → recommend `cgsp_dual_pool` for promotion to CGSP default in riir-ai (separate riir-ai plan).
  - If G1–G4 pass but G5.2 shows no divergence improvement → keep opt-in, document as "reachability guarantee without personality benefit at this scale."
  - If any gate fails → demote to experimental, create issue.
  - **DECISION (2026-06-16):** G1–G4 PASS, G5 deferred to riir-ai (requires `NpcCgspRuntime`). Per the second branch above, **`cgsp_dual_pool` stays opt-in**. The reachability guarantee alone (G1: 30× cheaper per-cycle than reactive entropy detector, formal non-trapping) justifies the feature for trap-prone domains. Promotion to CGSP default deferred until riir-ai validates G5.2 personality divergence widening. No issue created — no gate failed.

---

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Sigmoid routing changes regret bound vs paper's ratio | G2.3 explicitly benchmarks sigmoid vs ratio — both must show O(log T). Research 249 §2.3 proves concavity transfers. |
| E-pool grows unbounded → memory + latency | Cap E-pool size (e.g., 64 items). Evict lowest-priority items on consolidation. Pre-allocate fixed-size ring buffer. |
| FaithfulnessProbe is too expensive for hot path | Run probe at consolidation cadence (every N cycles), not every cycle. Probe is O(1) finite-difference per item. |
| X-pool conjecture generation is slow (LLM call) | X-pool items can be pre-generated at spawn (from faction template superset) or generated offline. Hot path only selects, doesn't generate. |
| Dual-pool overhead exceeds plasma budget | G5.3 gates on < 0.5µs overhead. Sigmoid + branch is ~10ns. Consolidation scan is O(E-pool size), done every N cycles not every cycle. |
| Single-pool CGSP already good enough (G5.2 flat) | Acceptable — means the reachability guarantee is the value, not the growth. Keep opt-in for the guarantee, document as such. |
