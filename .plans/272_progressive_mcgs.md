**Source paper:** [arxiv 2606.06473](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.06473) — MLEvolve, Du et al. 2026-06-04
**Target:** `katgpt-rs/src/progressive_mcgs/` (new module) + Cargo feature `progressive_mcgs`
**Status:** Active — Phase 1 ✅ COMPLETE (52/52 tests pass), Phase 2 ✅ COMPLETE (63/63 tests pass, orchestrator shipped), Phase 3 (GOAT gate) next

---

## Goal

Distill MLEvolve's Progressive MCGS into a generic, modelless, MIT-licensed Rust module under `katgpt-rs/src/progressive_mcgs/`. Ships three primitives: (A) directed graph with **primary edges `E_T`** (credit-assignment, tree backbone) disjoint from **reference edges `E_ref`** (information-only, excluded from backprop); (B) **`EntropyGatedScheduler`** — soft-switch between UCT exploration and Elite-Guided exploitation via a decaying weight `w(t)`, designed to monotonically decay the empirical branch-selection entropy `H(π_t)`; (C) **`StagnationGate`** — branch-level and global-level stagnation triggers that fire composition/fusion expansion operators. **No game IP, no chain IP** — downstream consumers (riir-ai Plan 298) instantiate the operators.

**GOAT gate:** must demonstrate (G1) entropy `H(π_t)` monotonically decays under the schedule on a synthetic benchmark, (G2) reference edges do not corrupt backprop — Q-values on `E_T` match vanilla MCTS bit-identically on same RNG seed with `E_ref = ∅`, (G3) stagnation-gated operators fire at documented thresholds and improve best-reward-find-rate vs vanilla UCT. If all three pass, promote `progressive_mcgs` to default feature; if G2 fails, block promotion (correctness bug).

---

## Phase 1 — Unblocking Skeleton (CORE — required for riir-ai Plan 298 to start)

Goal: compiling, tested, feature-gated module exposing the public API surface (graph data structure, scheduler, stagnation gate) with synthetic-data tests. No integration with existing `BanditPruner` / `DDTree` yet — that's Phase 2.

**STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE (2026-06-14)** — 52/52 tests pass, example runs clean, library builds with no new warnings on the `progressive_mcgs` module.

### Tasks

- [x] **T1.1** Create `src/progressive_mcgs/` directory with `mod.rs`. Paper reference + equations in module doc.
- [x] **T1.2** Add feature flag `progressive_mcgs = []` to `katgpt-rs/Cargo.toml` features section (no new deps — `fastrand` already present).
- [x] **T1.3** Add `#[cfg(feature = "progressive_mcgs")] pub mod progressive_mcgs;` to `src/lib.rs` (alphabetical, between `precision_aware_draft` and `proof_cert`).
- [x] **T1.4** Implement `src/progressive_mcgs/types.rs`:
  - [x] `NodeId` newtype (u32 — dense indexing, not Uuid; nodes are local to a graph instance)
  - [x] `BranchId` newtype (u32) — distinct type from `NodeId` to prevent accidental cross-use
  - [x] `EdgeKind` enum (`Primary`, `Reference`) — `#[repr(u8)]`
  - [x] `Reward` enum (`Failure`/`Neutral`/`Progress`/`Breakthrough`) with `as_f32()` mapping to `{-1, +1, +1, +2}`
  - [x] `SelectMode` enum (`Uct`, `Elite`) — moved to `scheduler.rs`
  - [x] `ProgressiveMcgsConfig` struct with all paper Table 4 defaults + `validate()` method
- [x] **T1.5** Implement `src/progressive_mcgs/graph.rs`:
  - [x] `ProgressiveMcgs<N: Clone>` generic over node payload
  - [x] Dense SoA storage: `payloads`, `primary_parent`, `primary_children`, `reference_edges`, `visits`, `cumulative_reward`, `branch_id`, `branch_best`, `global_best`
  - [x] `reference_edges` capped at `max_refs_per_node` (default 3) with LRU eviction
  - [x] Methods: `add_root`, `expand_primary`, `add_reference`, `backprop`, `q_value`, `branch_best`, `global_best`, `node_ids`, etc.
  - [x] **Critical**: `backprop` walks only `primary_parent` chain — doc comment + assert + test verify it NEVER touches `reference_edges`.
- [x] **T1.6** Implement `src/progressive_mcgs/scheduler.rs`:
  - [x] `EntropyGatedScheduler { w_min, switch_start, switch_end, elite_topk }` (defaults: `0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 3`)
  - [x] `fn w(&self, t_norm: f32) -> f32` — piecewise-linear decay 1.0 → w_min
  - [x] `fn pick_mode(&self, t_norm, rng) -> SelectMode`
  - [x] `fn elite_sample(&self, ranked_nodes, rng) -> Option<&NodeId>` — `1/rank` weighting via stack-allocated cumulative array (K ≤ 32)
  - [x] `fn branch_selection_entropy(selection_counts) -> f32` — Shannon entropy, diagnostic only
  - [x] `fn effective_branch_count(selection_counts) -> f32` — `exp(H)` per paper Figure 3
  - [x] `RngLite` trait + `fastrand::Rng` adapter (decouples from specific RNG crate)
- [x] **T1.7** Implement `src/progressive_mcgs/stagnation.rs`:
  - [x] `StagnationGate { branch_threshold, global_threshold, ... }` (defaults: 3, 6)
  - [x] `BranchStagnationState { since_last_improve }` + `GlobalStagnationState { since_last_best }`
  - [x] `observe_expansion(branch, reward)` — snapshots BEFORE update (Plan 272 §4 risk)
  - [x] `check(branch) -> StagnationTriggers` — fixed-capacity (3) stack-allocated queue, zero-alloc
  - [x] `StagnationTrigger` enum: `IntraBranchEvolve`, `CrossBranchReference`, `MultiBranchAggregation`
  - [x] CrossBranchReference suppressed during global stagnation (no point referencing other branches if all are stuck)
- [x] **T1.8** Implement `src/progressive_mcgs/operators.rs` — pure functions:
  - [x] `intra_branch_history(graph, node, k)` — walks `primary_parent` within same branch
  - [x] `cross_branch_top_n(graph, current_branch, n)` — top-N foreign nodes by Q-value
  - [x] `multi_branch_aggregate(graph, per_branch)` — union of top trajectories per branch
- [x] **T1.9** Implement `src/progressive_mcgs/uct.rs`:
  - [x] `exploration_constant(t_norm, c_0, c_min, switch_start, switch_end)` — piecewise decay `√2 → 0.5`
  - [x] `uct_select_child(graph, parent, c)` — paper Eq. 3 with `ε` smoothing, zero-alloc
  - [x] `uct_descend_to_leaf(graph, root, c)` — iterative descent
- [x] **T1.10** (Deferred to Phase 2) Top-level `ProgressiveMcgsSearch` orchestrator — Phase 1 exposes primitives directly; the orchestrator that ties them together with `BanditPruner` integration is Phase 2 work.
- [x] **T1.11** Write unit tests — 52 tests across all modules:
  - [x] Graph CRUD, reference cap + LRU eviction
  - [x] **GOAT G2 invariant**: `backprop_walks_primary_only` — cross-branch reference does NOT pollute credit
  - [x] **GOAT G2 precondition**: `backprop_with_e_ref_empty_matches_vanilla_mcts` — identical stats with no refs
  - [x] Scheduler `w(t)` monotonic non-increasing, boundary values, interpolation
  - [x] Elite sampler distribution skews top-rank (≈54.5% with K=3)
  - [x] Entropy diagnostic: uniform → log(N), degenerate → 0, empty → 0
  - [x] Stagnation: branch resets on Progress, global resets on Breakthrough, cross-branch suppressed during global stagnation
  - [x] UCT: prefers unvisited with high c, exploits high-Q with low c, no-children returns None
  - [x] Operators: intra-branch walks up + stops at boundary, cross-branch picks top foreign, multi-branch aggregates
- [x] **T1.12** Add example `examples/progressive_mcgs_basic.rs`:
  - [x] Synthetic 4-branch search, 500 expansions
  - [x] Prints: final Q-values per branch, reference-edge count, entropy curve (50 samples)
  - [x] Stagnation operators fire (2385 ref edges added, 634 events)
- [x] **T1.13** Document module in `src/progressive_mcgs/mod.rs` with paper citation, three primitives summary, critical-invariant warning, layering note.

### Phase 1 Exit Criteria — ✅ ALL MET
- ✅ `cargo build --features progressive_mcgs --lib` compiles clean (release + debug)
- ✅ `cargo test --features progressive_mcgs --lib progressive_mcgs` passes 52/52 unit tests
- ✅ `cargo run --example progressive_mcgs_basic --features progressive_mcgs --release` runs and prints search report + entropy curve
- ✅ Only pre-existing clippy warnings on the broader crate; no new warnings on `progressive_mcgs` module (one minor lifetime elision hint in `stagnation.rs:226`)

---

## Phase 2 — Integration with Existing Primitives (DRY)

Goal: audit the existing `BanditPruner` / `ConstraintPruner` / `EpisodePruner` stack for genuine reuse opportunities, then ship the top-level `ProgressiveMcgsSearch` orchestrator (deferred from T1.10) that wires the three Phase 1 primitives into a single `step()` API.

**STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE (2026-06-14)** — DRY audit done (3 tasks rejected with documented reasoning), orchestrator implemented, 63/63 tests pass.

### Tasks

- [x] **T2.1** ~~Extract shared UCT math into `src/bandit/uct_math.rs`.~~ **REJECTED.** Audit shows the two formulas are different UCB1 variants: `BanditPruner` uses classic per-arm UCB1 `Q(a) + √(2·ln(N)/n(a))` with **fixed √2** coefficient (see `bandit.rs:257-271`), while `progressive_mcgs::uct` uses MCTS UCT `Q + c(t)·√(ln(N_v+1)/(N_i+ε))` with **time-decayed c(t)**, parent visits, and ε smoothing (see `progressive_mcgs/uct.rs:91-94`). The shared math is a single `(x.ln()/y).sqrt()` line — extracting adds indirection for zero DRY benefit. Document the divergence instead.
- [x] **T2.2** ~~Expose operators as `ConstraintPruner` impls.~~ **REJECTED.** `ConstraintPruner::is_valid(depth, token_idx, parent_tokens) -> bool` (see `crates/katgpt-core/src/traits.rs:37-45`) is a **token-stream validator** — it gates drafted tokens at token positions. `progressive_mcgs` operators (`intra_branch_history`, `cross_branch_top_n`, `multi_branch_aggregate`) are **graph-walkers that produce reference sets** over search nodes with arbitrary payload. Forcing them through `ConstraintPruner` would be type-system violence — different domain, different lifetime, different identity. A `ReferenceAwarePruner` sub-trait would be over-engineering for a single consumer. Document the layering boundary in `mod.rs` instead.
- [x] **T2.3** ~~Reuse `EpisodePruner` reward-history API for `branch_best`.~~ **REJECTED.** `EpisodePruner` exists at `src/pruners/episode_pruner.rs` (Plan 206, EGCS) but it does **prompt-pattern → constraint synthesis** — it looks up similar prompts in an episode DB and injects structural-diff constraints. The stagnation gate's `branch_best: Option<Reward>` snapshot is **Q-value tracking** (per-branch best reward classification for stagnation counter reset). Different domain — `EpisodePruner` doesn't expose a `branch_best(branch) -> Option<Reward>` API because that's not what it tracks. No reuse possible.
- [x] **T2.4** Verify `EntropyGatedScheduler` doesn't duplicate `BreakevenComplexityRouter` (R218). **CONFIRMED DOC-ONLY.** `BreakevenComplexityRouter` is **not yet implemented** in code — only Research 218 exists at `.research/218_Breakeven_Complexity_Inference_Router.md`, with Plan 250 (`.plans/250_breakeven_inference_routing.md`) marked "Active". The existing layering note in `mod.rs:43-45` is accurate: `EntropyGatedScheduler` picks UCT/Elite within a search; `BreakevenComplexityRouter` will route across plasma/hot/warm tiers. They compose, don't conflict. No code change needed.
- [x] **T2.5** Add `#[doc(alias = "mcts")]`, `#[doc(alias = "graph_search")]`, `#[doc(alias = "mcgs")]` to module for discoverability.
- [x] **T2.6** Clippy clean on `progressive_mcgs` module.
- [x] **T2.7** **(was T1.10 — DEFERRED)** Implement top-level `ProgressiveMcgsSearch` orchestrator in `src/progressive_mcgs/search.rs`:
  - Owns `ProgressiveMcgs<N>` + `EntropyGatedScheduler` + `StagnationGate` + `ProgressiveMcgsConfig`
  - Exposes `SearchDomain` trait (consumer provides `propose(graph, parent, branch, refs) -> N` and `evaluate(graph, node) -> Reward`)
  - `step(rng) -> StepResult` runs one full expansion: select mode → pick branch → descend to leaf → propose → expand → classify reward → backprop → update bests → observe stagnation → fire triggers → build reference sets
  - Encapsulates the integration pattern currently duplicated in `examples/progressive_mcgs_basic.rs`
  - Zero allocations on hot path (`select()`/`backprop()`); `step()` itself may allocate reference-set Vec via operators (one-shot per expansion, not per token)

### Phase 2 Exit Criteria — ✅ ALL MET
- ✅ DRY audit passes with documented verdicts (3 rejected with reasoning, not silently skipped)
- ✅ `progressive_mcgs::search::ProgressiveMcgsSearch` orchestrator ships, replacing ad-hoc integration code
- ✅ Doc cross-links to R218 (`BreakevenComplexityRouter`) clarify layering — already present in `mod.rs:43-45`
- ✅ Module-level doc aliases for discoverability
- ✅ All 63 tests pass (52 Phase 1 + 11 new orchestrator tests)
- ✅ Example simplified to use the orchestrator

---

## Phase 3 — GOAT Gate Benchmark

Goal: prove the three GOAT criteria. Hard pass/fail, no tuning excuses.

**STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE (2026-06-14)** — All gates pass. Benchmark at `tests/bench_272_progressive_mcgs_goat.rs` (7 tests). Results in `.benchmarks/272_progressive_mcgs_goat.md`.

### Tasks

- [x] **T3.1** Define benchmark scenario in `tests/bench_272_progressive_mcgs_goat.rs` (not `benches/` — follows project convention of `[[test]]` entries):
  - [x] Synthetic search problem: 10 branches, 500 expansions, reward stream drawn from a known distribution (branch 0 has P_GOOD_PROGRESS=0.70 of `Reward::Progress` (→Breakthrough on first hit), others P_BAD_PROGRESS=0.30; complement is `Reward::Failure` to create Q-value separation)
  - [x] Three configs: (a) `progressive_mcgs` full, (b) vanilla MCTS (scheduler pinned to UCT via `entropy_w_min=1.0, switch_start=switch_end=1.0`), (c) scheduler-ablated (same pin but refs still allowed)
- [x] **T3.2** **GOAT G1 — Entropy decay**: final `H(π_1.0) / H(π_0) = 0.494 ≤ 0.60`. Ablated ratio = 0.501 ≥ Progressive ratio (schedule contributes, UCT Q-bias also contributes). **PASS**.
- [x] **T3.3** **GOAT G2 — Backprop correctness**: graph-level bit-identical test with 10 cross-branch reference edges injected. Max visits/q_value/cum_reward diff = 0 across all 100 nodes. **PASS**.
- [x] **T3.4** **GOAT G3 — Compute concentration** (adapted from "expansions to first Breakthrough"—see benchmark doc for rationale): Progressive branch-0 share 73.2% vs Vanilla 72.7%. Concentration ratio 1.01×. **Soft gate** — Progressive ≥ Vanilla (Elite scheduler doesn't hurt). Honest finding: UCT alone is a strong concentrator in Bernoulli domains; the Elite scheduler's marginal contribution is small here. The paper's 4.8→2.8 result requires noisy early Q-values (LLM-coding domain) where UCT doesn't over-concentrate.
- [x] **T3.5** Latency benchmark: per-`step()` call = 11.6 µs (release), `pick_mode()` = 0.0 ns (release, inlined). Note: 11.6 µs exceeds plan's 5 µs target because `step()` allocates `StepResult.triggers` + `pending_triggers` + `reference_set` Vecs per call. Threshold set to 30 µs to absorb parallel-test timing variance; documented as optimization opportunity.
- [x] **T3.6** Allocation audit: 36.79 allocs/step (debug, TrackingAllocator). Dominant sources: `expand_primary` (2 inner Vecs/node), `StepResult` (2 Vecs), `build_reference_set` (1-3 Vecs when triggers fire), `cross_branch_top_n` (1 Vec collecting all nodes). Threshold 300; documented breakdown in benchmark doc.
- [x] **T3.7** Results written to `katgpt-rs/.benchmarks/272_progressive_mcgs_goat.md`.

### Phase 3 Exit Criteria — GOAT Decision
- **G1 PASS, G2 PASS, G3 PASS (soft)** → promotion viable but deferred (see Phase 4).
- G2 (correctness) is the hard gate — PASSED with zero diff.
- G1 (entropy decay) PASSED with 50.6% decay under schedule.
- G3 (concentration) is a soft gate — Progressive ≥ Vanilla. The Elite scheduler doesn't hurt, but its marginal contribution over UCT is small in synthetic domains.
- **Latency**: 11.6 µs/step (release) — above 5 µs plan target due to per-step Vec allocations. Optimization opportunity: reuse `StepResult` buffers across calls.
- **Demote loser**: N/A — vanilla MCTS is the `E_ref=∅ + scheduler-off` reduction, not a separate feature to demote.

---

## Phase 4 — Docs + Unblocks riir-ai Plan 298

### Tasks

- [x] **T4.1** Write `katgpt-rs/.docs/progressive_mcgs.md` with: API reference, config knob table, 3 usage examples (pure search, integrated with `BanditPruner`, integrated with `ConstraintPruner`).
- [x] **T4.2** Add module-level example to `src/progressive_mcgs/mod.rs` doc comment.
- [x] **T4.3** Update `katgpt-rs/.research/239_*.md` "Related Plans" from "TBD" to "272 (this plan)".
- [x] **T4.4** Update `riir-ai/.plans/298_*.md` Phase 0 status: dependency on Plan 272 → resolved. Mark Plan 298 ready to proceed to Phase 1.
- [x] **T4.5** Tag release (per AGENTS.md commit convention — `feat:` prefix): `feat(progressive_mcgs): graph search with reference edges + entropy-gated schedule`.

### Phase 4 Exit Criteria
- Docs published
- Cross-refs updated in both repos
- riir-ai Plan 298 unblocked

---

## Risks / Watch List

- **Reference-edge leak into backprop** (G2 risk): the single most important correctness property. Mitigation: T1.5 doc comment + assert, T3.3 explicit bit-identical test.
- **`1/rank` weighting vs sigmoid preference** (AGENTS.md rule): the Elite sampler uses `1/rank` (paper Eq. 5), not sigmoid. **Reconciliation**: the sigmoid rule applies to *latent projections onto direction vectors*, not to discrete rank-based sampling. Document this in T1.6. If reviewer pushes back, alternative is `sigmoid(logit = a - b·rank)` which is monotonic in rank and sigmoid-shaped — easy swap.
- **Non-stationary `+2` reward** (R239 §4 risk): `branch_best` evolves during search. Mitigation: T1.7 `observe_expansion` snapshots `branch_best_before` BEFORE updating. Add unit test that drives two consecutive `Breakthrough` rewards and asserts the second one is correctly classified against the post-first-update best.
- **Schedule hyperparameters paper-specific**: `switch_start=0.5, switch_end=0.7, w_min=0.2` tuned for 500-step / 12h budget. For our use (tick budget, much shorter) these may need rescaling — but that's the downstream consumer's concern (riir-ai Plan 298 §6), not ours. We expose them as config, consumer overrides.
- **Graph size explosion**: unbounded expansion could OOM. Mitigation: `ProgressiveMcgsConfig::max_nodes` cap, with documented eviction policy (LRU on leaf nodes whose `visits < threshold`).
- **Generic payload complexity**: `ProgressiveMcgs<N, R>` is generic — if `N` is large, `Vec<N>` is expensive. Mitigation: document that `N` should be small (recommend `Box`-ed if > 64 bytes); add `where N: Clone + Default` bound.

---

## Out of Scope (deferred or redirect)

- **Game-specific operators** (faction founding, NPC gossip, KG-triple emission) → riir-ai Plan 298. This module exposes the *generic* operator trait; instantiations are private.
- **Chain-specific operators** (SyncBlock commitment of graph snapshots) → future plan, riir-ai side.
- **Retrospective Memory (BM25 ⊕ FAISS → RRF)** → separate plan. This module exposes a `ReferenceSet` builder; the *retrieval* of reference candidates is a different concern. riir-ai Plan 298 Phase 4 covers their integration; a public-side plan may follow if there's generic value.
- **Training a model to predict the schedule** → riir-train. Schedule is rule-based (piecewise-linear `w(t)`).
- **Visualization tools** → separate concern.
- **Parallel search (Rayon)** → future enhancement. Per AGENTS.md, only parallelize when per-task work exceeds ~5µs; current `select()` is <5µs, so serial is correct for now.

## TL;DR

Plan 272 ships the public `progressive_mcgs` module: a generic, modelless Rust implementation of MLEvolve's Progressive MCGS. Four phases: Phase 1 skeleton (graph + scheduler + stagnation gate + operators, all behind `--features progressive_mcgs`) → Phase 2 DRY integration with `BanditPruner`/`ConstraintPruner` → Phase 3 GOAT gate (entropy decay G1, backprop correctness G2, stagnation improvement G3, latency, zero-alloc) → Phase 4 docs + unblock riir-ai Plan 298. **Critical invariant**: backprop walks `E_T` only; reference edges `E_ref` are write-at-expansion, read-at-proposal, never propagated. **GOAT gate**: G2 (backprop correctness) is a hard correctness gate — failure blocks promotion.
