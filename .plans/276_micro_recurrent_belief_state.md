# Plan 276: MicroRecurrentBeliefState — Implicit Per-Entity State Tracking Kernel

**Date:** 2026-06-15
**Research:** [katgpt-rs/.research/242_Topological_State_Tracking_Recurrent_Belief.md](../.research/242_Topological_State_Tracking_Recurrent_Belief.md)
- **Private guide:** [`riir-ai/.research/127_*.md`](../../../riir-ai/.research/127_Implicit_Microcognition_Crowd_NPC_Guide.md) — **reframed as GOAT design context** (verdict revised from Super-GOAT after `evolve_hla` prior-art check)
**Source paper:** [arXiv:2604.17121](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.17121) — Mozer, Siddiqui, Liu (DeepMind, Jun 2026), "The Topological Trouble With Transformers"
**Target:** Extend `katgpt-rs/crates/katgpt-core/src/sense/` (refactor `evolve_hla` into a trait + add attractor family) + new `micro_belief/` submodule for the trait + snapshot + bridge + Cargo feature `micro_belief`
**Status:** Active — Phase 0 (planning). **Verdict revised same day: Super-GOAT → GOAT** after prior-art check found `evolve_hla` already implements Family C.

---

## Goal

**Revised (verdict downgrade):** the prior-art check found `ReconstructionState::evolve_hla()` already implements Family C (delta-rule SSM) — per-NPC recurrent latent state tracking is *shipped*. This plan is no longer "ship a new primitive"; it is **"extend `evolve_hla` into a trait, add an attractor-family variant (Family A) for beliefs-with-hysteresis, and optionally add kernel-as-versioned-snapshot for per-NPC divergence."**

The GOAT-gate question becomes: **does attractor update (`σ(W_s·s + W_x·x + b)`) reduce long-horizon flip-flops vs HLA's leaky integrator on a coherence benchmark?** If yes → promote attractor family as an opt-in variant (probably NOT default — HLA's leaky integrator is battle-tested). If no → demote to Gain, keep only the trait unification.

**GOAT gate (G1 for the trait/snapshot mechanics; G2 for the attractor quality claim):**
- G1.1 Determinism (bit-identical `s_T` for fixed input sequence) — applies to all families
- G1.2 Boundedness (`‖s_t‖` stays bounded over 10k ticks; Family A doesn't diverge)
- G1.3 Bridge ranking preservation (scalar projection preserves belief ranking) — already true for existing `SenseModule::project`, just re-verify
- G1.4 Latency (Family A ≤ 100ns/NPC/tick CPU SIMD; ≤ 50ns ANE batch) — HLA's `evolve_hla_simd` is the baseline to match
- G1.5 Freeze/thaw atomicity for `MicroRecurrentKernelSnapshot` (readers never see torn kernel swap)
- **G2.1 (the actual GOAT gate for this plan):** attractor-family coherence ≥ HLA-leaky-integrator coherence on a long-horizon (1000-turn) dialogue/interaction benchmark, with strictly less flip-flopping. If G2.1 fails, attractor stays opt-in behind a sub-flag and the trait unification is the only shippable output.

**Out of scope (stays in riir-ai/.plans/304):** NPC tick integration changes, ANE batch dispatch for the attractor variant, CGSP fusion, collapse detector. This plan ships *only* the trait refactor + attractor family + snapshot + the G2.1 benchmark.

## Phase 0 — Pre-flight (this plan)

### Tasks

- [x] **T0.1** Research note `katgpt-rs/.research/242_*.md` created.
- [x] **T0.2** Private guide `riir-ai/.research/127_*.md` created (Super-GOAT mandatory output).
- [x] **T0.3** This plan created.
- [x] **T0.4** Audit existing freeze/thaw snapshot infra: locate `LoRAWeightVersion`, `LoRAHotSwap`, BLAKE3 commit path. Confirm `MicroRecurrentKernelSnapshot` can reuse the same atomic-swap plumbing without forking it. (Output: a 1-paragraph note in this plan's §Notes identifying the exact trait/struct to extend.)
- [x] **T0.5** Audit existing `SenseModule::project` (the bridge) — confirm it already does dot-product + sigmoid (it does, per the grep). The new trait's `project_to_scalars()` should *delegate* to it, not duplicate it.
- [x] **T0.6** **NEW (post-verdict-revision):** Confirm `evolve_hla` + `evolve_hla_simd` call sites — anywhere else in the codebase that calls them directly needs to either (a) keep working unchanged via the trait impl, or (b) be updated to call through the trait. Grep for `evolve_hla` callers before the refactor.

### Phase 0 Audit Results (T0.4–T0.6)

**T0.4 — Snapshot infra (katgpt-rs side, not riir-ai):** The plan text mentioned `LoRAWeightVersion`/`LoRAHotSwap`, but those live in **riir-ai** (`riir-ai/crates/riir-engine/src/episode_buffer.rs`), not katgpt-rs. katgpt-rs (public engine) uses a *different* atomic-swap idiom:
- **`SenseHotSwap`** (`katgpt-rs/crates/katgpt-core/src/sense/hotswap.rs`): `AtomicPtr<Box<SenseModule>>` + `AtomicBool` lock flag, fixed-size array indexed by `SenseKind`. This is the lock-free hot-swap primitive in the public repo.
- **`SenseModule::commit()` / `verify()`** (`types.rs` L4864–4907): BLAKE3 commitment over struct bytes with `TernaryDir` padding zeroed first for determinism. Same pattern reused by `JlProjectionMatrix::commit()/verify()` (`shard_embedding.rs`) and `GpartAdapter::commitment()/verify()` (`types.rs`).
- **`MerkleOctree`** (`merkle.rs`): hierarchical BLAKE3 for KG latent octree nodes (Plan 221-M).

**Decision (R3 resolved):** Write a parallel `KernelHotSwap` reusing the `SenseHotSwap` `AtomicPtr` primitive (NOT `arc_swap` crate — not a current katgpt-rs dep; NOT `LoRAWeightVersion` — that's riir-ai-private game IP). `MicroRecurrentKernelSnapshot` reuses the `SenseModule::commit()` BLAKE3-over-struct-bytes pattern directly. No forking needed; the BLAKE3 commitment + AtomicPtr swap primitives are already public-engine idioms.

**T0.5 — Bridge confirmed:** `SenseModule::project(hla_state: &[f32; 8]) -> f32` (`types.rs` L4825) does exactly dot-product (ternary sign × hla_val × row_scale, FMA-fused) + `crate::simd::fast_sigmoid(dot)` scaled by `confidence`. This IS the dot-product + sigmoid bridge. The new trait's `project_to_scalars()` will **delegate** to this pattern (operating on the belief vector the same way `project` operates on `hla_state`), reusing `crate::simd::fast_sigmoid` and the dot-product helper. No duplication.

**T0.6 — Call sites confirmed (safe to refactor):** `evolve_hla()` is called ONLY inside `ReconstructionState` methods: `reconstruct()` (L704), `reconstruct_matvec()` (L728), `reconstruct_with_weights()` (L753), and the shared `reconstruct_inner()` (L785, dispatches to scalar or SIMD). `evolve_hla_simd()` is called only in `reconstruct_inner()` behind `sense_composition` feature. **No external direct callers** — benchmarks (`reconstruction_bench.rs`) go through `ReconstructionState::reconstruct*`. The refactor is safe: move `evolve_hla` body into `LeakyIntegrator::step()` (Phase 2), make `ReconstructionState::evolve_hla()` a thin delegate. `reconstruct_inner` is the only dispatch site to update for the trait.

---

## Phase 1 — Core Skeleton + Family A (Attractor Loop)

**Unblocks:** G1.1, G1.2, G1.3, G1.4 (partial), G1.5 (partial). This is the GOAT-gate phase.

### Architecture (revised — extend existing sense/, not greenfield)

```text
katgpt-rs/crates/katgpt-core/src/
├── sense/
│   ├── reconstruction.rs       // EXISTING — evolve_hla() becomes an impl of the trait
│   ├── brain.rs                // EXISTING — NpcBrain::hla_state is the state vector
│   └── ...                     // EXISTING — SenseModule::project() is the bridge (unchanged)
└── micro_belief/               // NEW submodule (small)

    ├── attractor.rs            // Family A: s_t = σ(W_s·s_{t-1} + W_x·x_t + b)  [the GOAT candidate]
    ├── leaky.rs                // Family C wrapper: delegates to existing evolve_hla logic (zero-behavior-change refactor)
    ├── snapshot.rs             // MicroRecurrentKernelSnapshot (BLAKE3, versioned) — optional, for per-NPC divergence
    └── tests.rs                // G1.1–G1.5 + G2.1 (the coherence benchmark)
```

**Key refactor principle:** `ReconstructionState::evolve_hla()` logic moves into `leaky.rs` as `impl BeliefKernel for LeakyIntegrator`. The existing call site in the `expand → route → accumulate → evolve_hla` loop calls through the trait. **Zero behavior change for the default path** — this is critical to avoid regressing the shipped HLA benchmarks.

### Tasks

- [x] **T1.1** `types.rs`: define `MicroRecurrentBeliefState` trait
  ```rust
  pub trait MicroRecurrentBeliefState: Send + Sync {
      /// Belief vector dimension (fixed at construction).
      fn dim(&self) -> usize;

      /// Advance one tick: s_t = f(s_{t-1}, x_t). In-place update of `state`.
      /// Zero-allocation: no Vec creation; operates on the &mut [f32] slice.
      fn step(&self, state: &mut [f32], input: &[f32]);

      /// Bridge: project belief vector to K bounded scalars via sigmoid(dot).
      /// `directions` is `[K][dim]`, `out` is `&mut [f32; K]`.
      fn project_to_scalars(&self, state: &[f32], directions: &[[f32; /*dim*/]], out: &mut [f32]);

      /// Family identifier (for routing, snapshot versioning).
      fn family(&self) -> RecurrenceFamily;
  }

  #[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
  #[repr(u8)]
  pub enum RecurrenceFamily { Attractor = 0, LatentThought = 1, DeltaRule = 2 }
  ```
- [x] **T1.2** `types.rs`: `KernelConfig { dim: usize, family: RecurrenceFamily, ... }` with builder. Default `dim = 32` (fits L1, matches Plan 255 budget).
- [x] **T1.3** `attractor.rs`: `AttractorKernel { ws: [[f32; D]; D], wx: [[f32; D]; D], b: [f32; D] }` (use `#![feature(generic_const_exprs)]` if stable, else `const D: usize = 32` default + macro for other dims).
  - `step()`: compute `σ(W_s·s + W_x·x + b)` elementwise, write back to `state`.
  - SIMD via existing `wide` crate or std::simd; chunked 4 or 8 lanes for auto-vec.
  - Clamp `state[i]` to `[-CLAMP, CLAMP]` after update (CLAMP=6.0 default — sigmoid saturates by then anyway).
  **Implementation:** `Vec<f32>` row-major weights (R5 mitigation — generic const exprs not stable). State range `(-1, 1)` via `2·σ(·) − 1` to match HLA's `[-1, 1]` range for fair G2.1 comparison.
- [x] **T1.4** `bridge.rs`: `project_to_scalars(state, directions, out)`
- [x] **T1.5** `snapshot.rs`: `MicroRecurrentKernelSnapshot { family, dim, weights_blob: Vec<u8>, blake3: [u8; 32], version: u64 }`.
  - `commit(&self) -> [u8; 32]` — BLAKE3 over `(family, dim, weights_blob)`.
  - `verify(&self) -> bool` — recompute and compare.
  - Serialization via existing `serde` + `bincode` pattern (match whatever `LoRAWeightVersion` uses).
- [x] **T1.6** `mod.rs`: re-export public API, register module behind `micro_belief` feature flag in `lib.rs`.
- [x] **T1.7** `Cargo.toml`: add `micro_belief` feature, default-off until G1 passes. Dependencies: `blake3` (already in tree), `serde` (already), no new deps.
- [x] **T1.8** `tests.rs` — **G1.1 Determinism**:
  ```rust
  #[test] fn g1_1_determinism() {
      let kernel = AttractorKernel::from_seed(42, 32);
      let mut s_a = vec![0.0f32; 32];
      let mut s_b = vec![0.0f32; 32];
      let xs: Vec<Vec<f32>> = (0..1000).map(|i| deterministic_input(i)).collect();
      for x in &xs { kernel.step(&mut s_a, x); }
      for x in &xs { kernel.step(&mut s_b, x); }
      assert_eq!(s_a, s_b); // bit-identical
  }
  ```
- [x] **T1.9** `tests.rs` — **G1.2 Boundedness**:
  ```rust
  #[test] fn g1_2_boundedness() {
      let kernel = AttractorKernel::from_seed(42, 32);
      let mut s = vec![0.0f32; 32];
      let mut rng = ChaCha8Rng::seed_from_u64(7);
      for _ in 0..10_000 {
          let x: Vec<f32> = (0..32).map(|_| rng.gen_range(-1.0..1.0)).collect();
          kernel.step(&mut s, &x);
          for v in &s { assert!(*v >= -6.0 && *v <= 6.0, "attractor diverged"); }
      }
  }
  ```
- [x] **T1.10** `tests.rs` — **G1.3 Bridge ranking preservation** (property test):
  ```rust
  #[quickcheck] fn g1_3_ranking(sa: Vec<f32>, sb: Vec<f32>, d: Vec<f32>) -> bool {
      let (sa, sb, d) = pad_to_dim(sa, sb, d, 32);
      let dot_a = dot(&sa, &d); let dot_b = dot(&sb, &d);
      let sig_a = sigmoid(dot_a); let sig_b = sigmoid(dot_b);
      (dot_a.partial_cmp(&dot_b) == sig_a.partial_cmp(&sig_b))
  }
  ```
- [x] **T1.11** `tests.rs` — **G1.4 Latency** (criterion benchmark, gated):
  ```rust
  #[cfg(feature = "bench")] #[bench] fn g1_4_attractor_step_32(b: &mut Bencher) {
      let kernel = AttractorKernel::from_seed(42, 32);
      let mut s = vec![0.0f32; 32]; let x = vec![0.5f32; 32];
      b.iter(|| kernel.step(black_box(&mut s), black_box(&x)));
      // Assert ns < 100 in the GOAT-gate CI job.
  }
  ```
- [x] **T1.12** `tests.rs` — **G1.5 Freeze/thaw atomicity** (stress test, reuses existing `LoRAHotSwap` test harness if it has one; else write minimal):
  ```rust
  #[test] fn g1_5_snapshot_atomicity() {
      // 1000 reader threads call step() in a tight loop;
      // 1 swapper thread hot-swaps the kernel snapshot every 100ms;
      // assert no reader ever sees a torn read (panic / NaN / dimension mismatch).
  }
  ```
- [x] **T1.13** Run `cargo test --features micro_belief` — all G1 tests green.
  **DONE (2026-06-16):** `cargo test -p katgpt-core --no-default-features --features sparse_mlp,micro_belief,temporal_deriv --lib` → 165 passed, 0 failed (G1.4 informational in release, ~270ns/step — see Issue 024).
- [x] **T1.14** Run `cargo bench --features micro_belief,bench` — capture G1.4 numbers, paste into `katgpt-rs/.benchmarks/276_micro_belief_goat.md`.
  **PARTIAL:** No criterion bench wired yet (only the wall-clock test). The canonical bench needs a `[[bench]]` entry + `bench` feature. See Issue 024 for the ~270ns/step number from the wall-clock test. The G2.1 re-bench in release confirmed 273.2 ns/step.
- [x] **T1.15** Write `katgpt-rs/.benchmarks/276_micro_belief_goat.md` with the GOAT proof (G1.1–G1.5 pass/fail table + latency numbers).
  **DONE (2026-06-16):** `.benchmarks/276_micro_belief_goat.md` written with G1.1–G1.5 summary + G2.1 results table.

### GOAT Gate Decision (end of Phase 1)

- [x] **T1.16** If G1.1–G1.5 all pass → flip `micro_belief` to default-on in `Cargo.toml`. Update `.docs/01_overview.md` Feature Flags table.
  **DECISION (2026-06-16):** G1.4 FAILS (~270ns vs <100ns target, Issue 024). `micro_belief` stays opt-in per T1.17 fallback. G1.1/G1.2/G1.3/G1.5 pass; the trait unification + LeakyIntegrator (fast) ship as the only promotable output once Phase 2 refactor lands.
  **UPDATE (2026-06-16):** Phase 2 refactor landed (T2.1–T2.3 done); G2.1 ran and FAILED for the attractor (T5.2 demotion). Trait unification + LeakyIntegrator are the only promotable outputs. Attractor + LatentThought stay opt-in experiments. Default-on NOT warranted (attractor loses both G1.4 latency AND G2.1 coherence).
- [x] **T1.17** If G1.2 (stability) fails for Family A but Family C (Phase 2) passes → keep Family A behind `micro_belief_attractor` sub-flag, default to Family C. Document in `types.rs` doc-comment.
  **N/A (G1.2 passed for Family A):** Family A is stable. The demotion is driven by G2.1 (coherence quality), not G1.2 (stability). Family A stays behind the `micro_belief` flag as an opt-in experiment per the G2.1 verdict.
- [x] **T1.18** If G1.4 (latency) fails (>100ns) → profile with `perf record` / `Instruments`, identify bottleneck (likely SIMD lane width or memory layout), file as issue in `katgpt-rs/.issues/`.
  **DONE:** Issue 024 filed. Mitigations M1–M4 documented; M5 (accept latency, demote attractor) is now reinforced by the G2.1 coherence failure — the attractor is doubly non-default-on (slow AND less coherent than leaky).

---

## Phase 2 — Family C wrapper (zero-behavior-change refactor of evolve_hla)

**Why (revised):** This is no longer "the fallback" — it's the **default that already ships**. The task is to wrap the existing `evolve_hla` logic in the trait without changing behavior, so the call site can dispatch to either LeakyIntegrator (today's default) or AttractorKernel (the GOAT candidate) transparently.

### Tasks

- [x] **T2.1** `leaky.rs`: `LeakyIntegrator { lr, max_delta }` — move the body of `evolve_hla` into `impl BeliefKernel for LeakyIntegrator`. The existing `ReconstructionState::evolve_hla()` becomes a thin delegate.
  **DONE (2026-06-16):** Chose Option A (true DRY via shared ungated `leaky_core::leaky_step` primitive) instead of cfg-gated delegation. Honest finding: `evolve_hla` and `LeakyIntegrator::step` actually differ in normalization mass (sum-of-6 source activations vs sum-of-dim), so naive delegation would have changed behavior. Resolved by passing a precomputed `total` into the shared core. `evolve_hla()` → thin delegate to `leaky_step(state, padded, total_over_6, lr, max_delta)`. `LeakyIntegrator::step` → delegate to `leaky_step(state, input, total_over_dim, lr, max_delta)`. One math body, two callers, zero `micro_belief` feature coupling.
- [x] **T2.2** SIMD path: `evolve_hla_simd` logic moves into `LeakyIntegrator::step_simd()`; the existing method delegates.
  **PARTIAL (2026-06-16):** `evolve_hla_simd` gather deduped to use the new `TripleEvidence::kind_activations_padded()` helper (single source of truth for `KIND_MAP = [0,1,2,3,4,5,0,1]`). The SIMD fused-sub-scale body itself was NOT moved into `LeakyIntegrator::step_simd()` — the shared `leaky_step` core is scalar (the SIMD benefit at dim=8 is marginal per the existing doc). If a SIMD `LeakyIntegrator::step_simd` is needed later, it can wrap `leaky_step` or vendor the fused op; not load-bearing for the zero-behavior-change gate.
- [x] **T2.3** **Zero-behavior-change test:** the existing HLA benchmarks (`reconstruction_bench.rs`) produce identical numbers before and after the refactor. This is the regression gate.
  **DONE (2026-06-16):** Added `evolve_hla_is_byte_identical_to_inline_reference` — bit-for-bit `assert_eq!` between the refactored delegate and the verbatim pre-refactor inline math, exercising non-zero wrap positions (k0,k1) so the sum-of-6 vs sum-of-8 distinction is load-bearing. 18/18 reconstruction tests pass; 251 lib tests pass across `sparse_mlp,micro_belief,sense_composition,temporal_deriv`.
- [x] **T2.4** Backward-compat: `DeltaRuleKernel { alpha: [λ; D], beta: [0; D] }` (from the original Phase 2 plan) composed with sigmoid bridge matches `SpatialBelief::decay_confidence()` — only relevant if Plan 262's static-decay fallback needs a path; otherwise skip.
  **N/A — skipped per plan note:** Plan 262's static-decay fallback does not currently route through this kernel; `DeltaRuleKernel` is not needed. The `RecurrenceFamily::DeltaRule` variant is already represented by `LeakyIntegrator`.

---

## Phase 3 — Family B (Latent-Thought Loop) + Composability

**Why:** Family B (K iterations of Family A before advancing) is for "deliberation ticks" — negotiation, planning, multi-step social reasoning. Opt-in; not on the critical path for G1.

### Tasks

- [x] **T3.1** `latent_thought.rs`: `LatentThoughtKernel { inner: AttractorKernel, k_iters: u8 }`.
  - `step()`: apply `inner.step()` K times with the same input `x_t`. K=1 reduces to Family A.
  **DONE (2026-06-16):** `micro_belief/latent_thought.rs` (250 lines). `from_seed(seed, dim, k_iters)`, `with_k_iters` builder, `impl MicroRecurrentBeliefState` (delegates `dim`/`project_to_scalars` to inner + bridge; `step` applies inner.step K times; `family()` → `LatentThought`). Registered in `mod.rs`.
- [x] **T3.2** Tests: same G1 suite. Add G1.6: K=1 case bit-identical to Family A with same weights.
  **DONE (2026-06-16):** G1.6 (`k_equals_one_is_bit_identical_to_attractor`) passes — `LatentThoughtKernel(seed=42,dim=16,k=1)` produces byte-identical state to `AttractorKernel(seed=42,dim=16)` over 100 steps. Also added `determinism`, `family_is_latent_thought`, `k_equals_zero_is_noop`, `k_iters_increases_settling_speed`.
- [x] **T3.3** Composability test: a `TrainingFreeLoop` (Plan 136) wrapping a model that contains a `MicroRecurrentBeliefState` stage works end-to-end. (Validates the "composable, not redundant" claim in Research 242 §2.3.)
  **N/A — deferred:** Plan 136's `TrainingFreeLoop` wiring is a cross-module integration concern (Plan 136 is its own active plan). The trait-level composability is established by G1.6 (Family B composes over Family A bit-identically) and the existing `MicroRecurrentBeliefState` trait contract. Cross-plan composability test deferred to when Plan 136 lands its integration harness.

---

## Phase 4 — Docs + Examples

### Tasks

- [x] **T4.1** `katgpt-rs/.docs/NN_micro_belief.md` — API reference (trait, families, snapshot, bridge).
  **DONE (2026-06-16):** `.docs/26_micro_belief.md` — TL;DR, GOAT verdict table, trait/families/snapshot/bridge API, latent-vs-raw boundary table, shared-core explanation, usage.
- [x] **T4.2** `katgpt-rs/examples/micro_belief_demo.rs` — minimal example: construct a kernel, run 1000 steps, project to 3 scalars, print. Shows the full lifecycle.
  **DONE (2026-06-16):** `examples/micro_belief_demo.rs` — exercises Family C (LeakyIntegrator) + bridge + Family A + Family B + snapshot.verify() + G1.6 sanity. Registered in `Cargo.toml` (`required-features = ["micro_belief"]`). Runs clean in release.
- [x] **T4.3** Update `.docs/01_overview.md` Feature Flags table with `micro_belief` row.
  **DONE (2026-06-16):** Added `micro_belief`, `swir_switch_thinking`, `temporal_deriv`, `faithfulness_probe`, `triggered_injection`, `chain_fold` rows (the sibling Plan 275–278 flags were also missing). Each row records its GOAT status.
- [x] **T4.4** Update `.docs/02_architecture.md` with the new `micro_belief/` module entry.
  **DONE (2026-06-16):** Appended `## MicroRecurrentBeliefState` section with trait signature, per-family module table, GOAT verdict, and feature gate. Cross-linked to `.docs/26_micro_belief.md`.

---

## Phase 5 — GOAT Gate G2.1 + Decision + Commit

### Tasks

- [x] **T5.0** **NEW (the actual GOAT gate for this plan):** Build the G2.1 coherence benchmark — a synthetic long-horizon (1000-step) input sequence with injected ambiguity/flip-flop triggers (analog of the paper's "bank" polysemy). Run LeakyIntegrator (HLA default) vs AttractorKernel (Family A). Measure flip-flop rate + belief stability.
  **DONE (2026-06-16):** `micro_belief/coherence_bench.rs` (393 lines). 1000-step synthetic sequence: strong dim-0 signal (steps 0–399), ambiguous near-uniform noise (400–599), strong dim-1 signal (600–999). Identity direction matrix for projection. Results (release, bit-identical in debug):
  | Kernel | Flip-flops | Ambig-window argmax var |
  |---|---|---|
  | **LeakyIntegrator (Family C)** | **1** | 0.0000 |
  | AttractorKernel (Family A) | 569 | 20.3618 |
  | LatentThoughtKernel (Family B, K=3) | 560 | 20.4439 |
  **Honest root cause:** the plan's hysteresis hypothesis assumed *trained* attractor weights that create fixed-point basins. At random Xavier init, `AttractorKernel` is a generic nonlinear dynamical system whose argmax is highly sensitive to ambiguous-window noise. The leaky integrator wins because it is a monotone additive accumulator with a per-tick delta clamp (`max_delta=0.2`) — once it accumulates strong evidence on dim 0, the `±0.05` ambiguous noise is below the clamp threshold and barely moves the state. Making the attractor competitive would require training the recurrent weights (out of scope — Plan 276 is training-free/freeze-thaw only).
- [x] **T5.1** Run G2.1. **If attractor wins (less flip-flopping, ≥X% coherence gain)** → promote `micro_belief_attractor` as an opt-in variant (NOT default — HLA leaky is battle-tested). Document in `.docs/01_overview.md`.
  **NOT MET:** Attractor does NOT win. Skip promotion.
- [x] **T5.2** **If attractor loses or ties** → demote to Gain. Keep the trait unification + LeakyIntegrator wrapper as the only shippable output. Attractor family stays behind `micro_belief_attractor` sub-flag for experimentation.
  **DECISION (2026-06-16): DEMOTE attractor family to Gain.** Attractor loses decisively (569× more flip-flops than leaky's 1). Combined with the G1.4 latency failure (~273 ns/step), the attractor family is doubly non-default-on. Only the trait unification + `LeakyIntegrator` (which delegates to the shared `leaky_core` and is byte-identical to the shipped `evolve_hla`) are promotable outputs. Attractor + `LatentThoughtKernel` remain behind the `micro_belief` flag as opt-in experiments for future trained-weight exploration.
- [x] **T5.3** Commit with `feat:` (if attractor promoted) or `refactor:` (if only trait unification shipped) prefix on `develop`.
  **DECISION:** `refactor:` prefix — only trait unification + LeakyIntegrator shipped as promotable output; attractor demoted.
- [x] **T5.4** Mark all `- [ ]` tasks in this plan as `- [x]` when complete.
  **DONE** (this update).

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| **R1: Family A diverges** (G1.2 fails) | Clamp after update (T1.3); fall back to Family C (Phase 2) as default; gate Family A behind sub-flag. |
| **R2: G1.4 latency > 100ns** | Profile; likely fix is memory layout (SoA vs AoS) or wider SIMD lanes. File issue if not fixable in 1-2 attempts. |
| **R3: Freeze/thaw atomicity hard to extend** (T0.4 reveals `LoRAHotSwap` is LoRA-specific) | Either generalize the trait in `LoRAHotSwap`, or write a parallel `KernelHotSwap` reusing the same primitives. Decide in T0.4. |
| **R4: Bridge function signature mismatch** (T0.5) | Adapt `project_to_scalars` to match existing `latent_to_raw_scalar`; or extract a shared trait. |
| **R5: Generic const expr (`[f32; D]`) not stable** | Use `Vec<f32>` internally with `dim` checked at construction; or macro-generate for D=32/64/128. Performance impact negligible at D=32. |

## TL;DR

**Verdict revised Super-GOAT → GOAT** after a prior-art check found `ReconstructionState::evolve_hla()` already implements the core (per-NPC recurrent latent state + sigmoid bridge — it's literally Family C of the proposed primitive, already shipped and benchmarked). This plan is now **"extend `evolve_hla` into a `BeliefKernel` trait, add an attractor-family variant (Family A) for beliefs-with-hysteresis, and benchmark attractor vs leaky on a long-horizon coherence task (G2.1)."** The trait unification + LeakyIntegrator wrapper is a zero-behavior-change refactor; the attractor family is the GOAT candidate that must beat HLA's leaky integrator on flip-flop rate to justify its existence. If G2.1 fails, attractor stays an opt-in experiment and only the trait refactor ships. The bridge (`SenseModule::project`) and sync-boundary discipline are reused unchanged — HLA already got those right.
