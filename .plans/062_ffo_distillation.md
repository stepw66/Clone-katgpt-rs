# BLOCKED BY Plan 063-064
# Plan 062: FFO Distillation — Verify Active-Set Masking Already Captured by BanditPruner

**Branch:** `develop/feature/062_ffo_distillation`
**Depends on:** Plan 053 (δ-Mem Modelless Distillation — "NO GAIN" precedent), Plan 030 (Bandit)
**Research:** `.research/30_FFO_First_Order_Differentiable_Optimization.md`
**Code:** `.raw/FFOLayer/` (local source audit — `ffocp_eq.py`, `ffoqp_eq.py`)
**Goal:** Verify whether FFOLayer's active-set dual-cutoff masking (arXiv:2512.02494 §4.1) provides any gain over our existing `BanditPruner` which already blends `domain × bandit_q`. Benchmark-first: measure before, implement minimal change, measure after. **Expect "NO GAIN" like Plan 053.**

## Tasks

- [ ] T0: Plan creation
- [ ] T1: Port FFOLayer finite-difference hypergradient correctness test from `.raw/FFOLayer/ffo_sdp.py`
- [ ] T2: Benchmark baseline — `BanditPruner` Q-value distribution analysis (is masking already happening?)
- [ ] T3: Add `dual_cutoff` field to `BanditPruner` — skip arms below Q-value threshold in `relevance()`
- [ ] T4: Unit test — verify cutoff masks low-Q arms, preserves high-Q arms
- [ ] T5: Benchmark T3 vs baseline — DDTree nodes, latency, acceptance rate
- [ ] T6: Honest verdict — commit if gain, revert+document if no gain
- [ ] T7: Run clippy, fix warnings, commit

## Honest Assessment

### Why This Plan Might Show "NO GAIN"

1. **BanditPruner already does the blending.** `relevance()` returns `(domain * bandit).clamp(0.0, 1.0)`. When `bandit_q` is low, the product is low — effectively "masking" without an explicit cutoff. FFOLayer's `dual_cutoff` adds a hard threshold; our bandit does soft masking via multiplication.

2. **The trait signature doesn't support wrappers.** `ScreeningPruner::relevance(&self, depth, token_idx, parent_tokens) -> f32` — no Q-value parameter. A `DualMaskedPruner` wrapper CAN'T access Q-values unless we modify the trait. Adding a field to `BanditPruner` itself is the only clean path.

3. **DDTree explores by marginals, not by pruner scores alone.** Even if we mask low-Q arms to 0.0, the tree still explores all non-zero-marginal paths. The pruner influences beam scoring, not tree structure. Masking might not reduce node count at all.

4. **Plan 053 precedent.** δ-Mem's associative memory was mathematically correct but showed "+2500% latency, 0% tree quality improvement" because correcting a single scalar relevance score is too simple a surface for the technique's value prop.

### What Actually IS Testable

| Claim | Testable? | How |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| FFOLayer finite-difference hypergradient matches autodiff | ✅ Yes | Port `ffo_sdp.py` test — compare FD gradient vs analytical gradient |
| BanditPruner already masks low-Q arms | ✅ Yes | Analyze Q-value distribution after N episodes — count arms near 0.0 |
| Explicit cutoff improves over soft masking | ✅ Yes | A/B benchmark with/without cutoff |
| Schur complement helps AHLA | ⚠️ Marginal | AHLA already 95% SDPA throughput, unlikely to move needle |

## Architecture

### T1: Correctness Test — Finite-Difference Hypergradient

Port the SDP gradient verification from `.raw/FFOLayer/ffo_sdp.py`:

```rust
// tests/ffo_gradient_correctness.rs

/// Verify that finite-difference hypergradient matches analytical gradient.
/// Direct port of FFOLayer's ffo_sdp.py — proves we understand the math.
///
/// Paper §4.2, Equation 11:
///   vx = (1/δ)[∇x[g̃(x, y*_δ) + ⟨λ*_δ, h̃(x, y*)⟩] - ∇x[g̃(x, y*) + ⟨λ*, h̃(x, y*)⟩]]
///
/// Test: solve a small QP, perturb, compare FD gradient vs autodiff gradient.
#[test]
fn test_ffo_fd_gradient_matches_autodiff() {
    // 1. Define small QP: min ½ xᵀQx + pᵀx  s.t. Ax = b, Gx ≤ h
    // 2. Solve → get (x*, λ*, ν*)
    // 3. Perturb objective by δ·cᵀx → solve → get (x*_δ, λ*_δ)
    // 4. Compute FD gradient: vx = (1/δ)[Lagrangian_grad(perturbed) - Lagrangian_grad(original)]
    // 5. Compare with autodiff gradient (finite difference on parameters)
    // Assert: ||vx - analytical|| < tolerance
}

/// Verify the KKT Schur complement gives exact solution for QP.
/// Port of ffoqp_eq.py kkt_schur_complement (L85-121).
#[test]
fn test_schur_complement_exact_qp_solution() {
    // 1. Q = random PD matrix, A = random constraint matrix
    // 2. Solve min ½ zᵀQz + pᵀz s.t. Az = b
    //    via Schur: L=chol(Q+εI), S=A·Q⁻¹Aᵀ, dlam=chol_solve(rhs,chol(S)), dz=-chol_solve(...)
    // 3. Verify KKT residual: ||Q·dz + Aᵀ·dlam + p|| < ε AND ||A·dz - b|| < ε
}
```

**Gate T1:** Both tests must pass before proceeding. This proves the math is correct in Rust.

### T2: Baseline — BanditPruner Q-Value Distribution

```rust
// tests/bench_ffo_distillation.rs

/// Analyze whether BanditPruner already provides "active-set masking".
/// Run N episodes, record Q-value distribution, check if low-Q arms
/// are effectively suppressed by the domain × bandit product.
#[test]
fn test_baseline_bandit_q_distribution() {
    // 1. Create BanditPruner<NoScreeningPruner> with 27 arms
    // 2. Run 1000 episodes with random rewards
    // 3. Record: Q-value per arm, relevance() output per arm
    // 4. Print: histogram of Q-values, count of arms with relevance < 0.01
    //
    // Key question: after training, how many arms have effectively zero relevance?
    // If most low-Q arms already return ~0.0, explicit cutoff adds nothing.
}
```

**Gate T2:** If ≥80% of arms already have relevance < 0.01 after training, the "masking" is already happening. Skip T3-T5, go straight to "NO GAIN" verdict.

### T3: Dual Cutoff in BanditPruner

Instead of a separate wrapper (which can't access Q-values), add a cutoff field directly:

```rust
// src/pruners/bandit.rs — modification to existing BanditPruner

pub struct BanditPruner<P: ScreeningPruner> {
    inner: P,
    strategy: BanditStrategy,
    stats: BanditStats,
    thompson_cache: Vec<f32>,
    // ... existing fields ...

    /// FFOLayer-inspired dual cutoff: arms with Q < cutoff get relevance = 0.0.
    /// Distilled from ffocp_eq.py backward pass (L1248-1269):
    ///   mask = (dual >= cutoff) → 1.0 else 0.0
    /// When 0.0 (disabled), behaves identically to current BanditPruner.
    dual_cutoff: f32,
}

// In ScreeningPruner impl:
fn relevance(&self, depth: usize, token_idx: usize, parent_tokens: &[usize]) -> f32 {
    // ... existing domain + cold start checks ...

    // NEW: hard cutoff for low-Q arms (FFOLayer active-set masking)
    if self.dual_cutoff > 0.0 && self.arm_visits(token_idx) > 0 {
        if self.arm_q(token_idx) < self.dual_cutoff {
            return 0.0; // masked — "inactive constraint"
        }
    }

    // ... existing bandit score computation + harmonic blend ...
}
```

**Key design choice:** `dual_cutoff = 0.0` means disabled (current behavior). Any non-zero value activates masking. This makes the change backward-compatible and benchmark-comparable.

### T4: Unit Test — Cutoff Behavior

```rust
#[test]
fn test_dual_cutoff_masks_low_q_arms() {
    let mut bp = BanditPruner::new(
        NoScreeningPruner,
        BanditStrategy::Ucb1,
        5, // 5 arms
    );
    bp.dual_cutoff = 0.3;

    // Arm 0: high Q (should pass)
    bp.update(0, 0.8);
    bp.update(0, 0.9);
    // Arm 1: low Q (should be masked)
    bp.update(1, 0.1);
    bp.update(1, 0.05);
    // Arm 2: unvisited (should NOT be masked — exploration)

    bp.prepare_episode(&mut Rng::seed_from_u64(42));

    let r0 = bp.relevance(0, 0, &[]);
    let r1 = bp.relevance(0, 1, &[]);
    let r2 = bp.relevance(0, 2, &[]);

    assert!(r0 > 0.0, "high-Q arm should have positive relevance");
    assert_eq!(r1, 0.0, "low-Q arm should be masked by dual_cutoff");
    assert!(r2 > 0.0, "unvisited arm should not be masked (exploration)");
}

#[test]
fn test_dual_cutoff_disabled_by_default() {
    let bp = BanditPruner::new(NoScreeningPruner, BanditStrategy::Ucb1, 5);
    assert_eq!(bp.dual_cutoff, 0.0, "default cutoff should be 0 (disabled)");
}
```

**Gate T4:** Tests must pass — proves the masking logic is correct.

### T5: A/B Benchmark

```rust
#[test]
fn test_bench_dual_cutoff_vs_baseline() {
    let config = Config::micro();

    // A: Baseline (dual_cutoff = 0.0)
    // B: Treatment (dual_cutoff = 0.2)
    // C: Treatment (dual_cutoff = 0.5)

    // For each: run 1000 speculative steps with SimulatedVerifier
    // Record: DDTree nodes explored, latency per build, acceptance rate

    // Print comparison table:
    // | Config        | Nodes | Latency | Accept% |
    // |---------------|-------|---------|---------|
    // | baseline      |  N    |  T      |  A%     |
    // | cutoff=0.2    |  N'   |  T'     |  A'%    |
    // | cutoff=0.5    |  N''  |  T''    |  A''%   |

    // Gate: proceed only if cutoff shows ≤5% node reduction WITH ≤3% acceptance regression
}
```

## Success Criteria (Honest)

| Metric | "GAIN" Threshold | "NO GAIN" Threshold |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| DDTree nodes | ≤5% fewer | ≥0% (no change or more) |
| Latency | ≤3% faster | ≥0% (no change or slower) |
| Acceptance rate | ≤5% regression | >5% regression |
| Bandit Q distribution | <80% arms already masked | ≥80% arms already near-zero |

**Expected outcome:** "NO GAIN" — BanditPruner's soft `domain × bandit` blending already captures the active-set masking concept. Hard cutoff adds no signal because multiplication already suppresses low-Q arms.

## Risk Assessment

**Very low risk:** This plan adds one field (`dual_cutoff: f32`) and a 4-line check to existing `BanditPruner`. If no gain, we set `dual_cutoff = 0.0` (default) and nothing changes. Total code change: ~20 lines.

**Precedent:** Plan 053 (δ-Mem) showed the same pattern — mathematically correct technique, no gain on our tree-scoring surface. We documented the honest verdict and moved on.

## What Schur Complement Would Look Like (NOT PLANNED — For Reference Only)

The Schur complement for AHLA would replace the asymmetric update's least-squares solve:

```text
Current:  AHLA update via direct matmul (O(d·dv))
Schur:    Cholesky + Schur complement KKT solve (O(d² + m²) where m = constraint dim)
```

**Why NOT planned:** AHLA already achieves 95% SDPA throughput (Plan 060). The Cholesky overhead for d=4-8 head dims would likely make it SLOWER, not faster. The Schur complement shines when the problem size is large (d >> 16), which is not our case. If someone wants to pursue this, benchmark the current `forward_ahla` first and prove the least-squares solve is a bottleneck.

## File Changes

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `tests/ffo_gradient_correctness.rs` | New — FD hypergradient + Schur complement correctness tests |
| `tests/bench_ffo_distillation.rs` | New — Q-value distribution analysis + A/B benchmark |
| `src/pruners/bandit.rs` | Add `dual_cutoff` field + masking logic (4 lines in `relevance()`) |
