# 104 — Fog of War Tactical Puzzle: Exploration-Based Solver Comparison

## Tasks

- [x] Vision system (BFS flood-fill, wall-blocking, radius 4)
- [x] FogState (seen, visible, discovered targets)
- [x] Frontier computation (tiles adjacent to unknown)
- [x] Exploration strategies (BF nearest, AI heuristic, Hybrid region+BF)
- [x] Single-phase iterative solver (explore while solving)
- [x] Game engine with fog integration (bridge blocks vision)
- [x] TUI with fog visualization (dim unseen, bright visible, remembered faded)
- [x] Headless benchmark across seeds (tactical_10_fog_bench.rs)
- [x] Three-round TUI flow with comparison metrics
- [x] Boss avoidance heuristics for AI/Hybrid — adjacent dodge (plan 113)
- [ ] Larger map / more rooms for richer exploration decisions

## Problem Statement

Current `tactical_07_strategic.rs` solvers are **omniscient** — they know all target
positions from the start. This makes BF = AI = Hybrid because:

1. Same information → same optimal path
2. `par_find_shortest_sequence` evaluates ALL valid candidates regardless of marginals
3. Pruner constrains tree structure identically for AI and Hybrid

**Real AI doesn't have perfect information.** In an MMO or real game:
- You only see what's in vision range
- You don't know what's behind doors/walls until you look
- You remember previously seen positions
- Exploration strategy matters

## Architecture

### New File
- `examples/tactical_09_fog.rs` — self-contained fog-of-war tactical puzzle

### Vision System

BFS flood-fill from player position:
- Radius: 4 tiles (BFS distance)
- Walls block vision (can see the wall tile but not through it)
- Bridge tiles when CLOSED block vision (like walls)
- Bridge tiles when OPEN allow vision through

This means you CANNOT see boxes/goal on the other side of a closed bridge.
You must discover and toggle levers to open the bridge, then explore beyond it.

### FogState

```rust
struct FogState {
    seen: HashSet<(usize, usize)>,      // ever seen (memory)
    visible: HashSet<(usize, usize)>,    // currently in vision range
    discovered_keys: Vec<(usize, usize)>,
    discovered_boxes: Vec<(usize, usize)>,
    discovered_levers: Vec<(usize, usize)>,
    discovered_traps: HashSet<(usize, usize)>,
    discovered_bridge: HashSet<(usize, usize)>,
    goal_pos: Option<(usize, usize)>,    // None until seen
}
```

### Single-Phase Iterative Solver

No separate explore/solve phases. The solver IS the explorer:

```
loop {
    1. update_vision()        → reveal nearby tiles
    2. discover_targets()     → record newly seen items
    3. choose_action()        → strategy-specific (THE KEY DIFFERENCE)
    4. execute_action()       → move, interact, boss moves
    5. if solved: break       → at goal, all boxes open, bridge open
}
```

Each action is ONE step (up/down/left/right). The solver picks one step at a time
based on its strategy. Total steps to solve = the score.

### Three Exploration Strategies

**🐻 BF — Greedy Nearest Frontier:**
- Find nearest tile adjacent to unexplored area (BFS from current position)
- Move toward it
- No intelligence about what might be there
- Handles interactions passively (picks up keys it walks over, toggles levers it stands on)
- Key-lock: tries keys in order until one works (brute force)
- Lever: tries levers it discovers, checks bridge after each

**🐰 AI — Heuristic Frontier Scoring:**
- Score each frontier tile by strategic value:
  - +3 near chokepoints (corridor entrances, bridge area)
  - +2 near dead-ends (likely to contain items)
  - +1 per adjacent unseen tile (more unknown = more valuable)
  - -2 if already visited recently (avoid backtracking)
- After discovering some targets, adjust strategy:
  - Has keys but no boxes → boxes probably beyond bridge → prioritize opening bridge
  - Has some levers → try combinations to open bridge
  - Bridge open → prioritize exploring beyond bridge
- Key-lock: reasons about which key fits (tries adjacent key first)
- Lever: uses Occam's razor (fewer toggles first, like current discover_levers)

**🦊 Hybrid — AI Region + BF Path:**
- AI decides WHICH frontier region to explore (macro strategy)
  - Region = cluster of nearby frontiers
  - AI scores regions by strategic value (same heuristics as 🐰)
- BF finds shortest path to best frontier in chosen region (micro tactics)
- Key-lock: AI reasons, but if reasoning fails, BF tries all keys
- Lever: AI discovers which levers matter, BF tries orderings
- When stuck (no good frontier): falls back to BF nearest frontier

### Expected Differentiation

On a 16×16 map with bridge chokepoint:

## Benchmark Results (seeds 42-71, 30 seeds)

| Metric | 🐻 BF | 🐰 AI | 🦊 Hybrid |
|--------|-------|-------|-----------|
| Avg Steps | 142.1 | **96.8** | 145.2 |
| Avg Discovery Step | 15.8 | 8.2 | **5.5** |
| Success (solved) | **5/30** | 2/30 | 1/30 |
| Avg Time | 63ms | **62ms** | 106ms |

### Key Finding: Smarter = Faster Discovery but More Deaths

**The paradox**: AI and Hybrid discover targets faster but DIE more often because
their heuristic-directed exploration beelines toward high-value areas where the boss
also happens to be. BF's "dumb" nearest-frontier exploration spreads movement more
unpredictably, accidentally avoiding the boss.

- 🦊 Hybrid discovers **earliest** (step 5.5) — AI region selection + BF pathfinding
  efficiently covers unknown areas
- 🐰 AI takes **fewest average steps** (96.8) — heuristic scoring avoids backtracking
- 🐻 BF **survives most** (5 wins) — unpredictable movement avoids boss encounters

This is a genuine research finding: under fog of war with hostile agents, greedy
heuristics can be counterproductive because they create predictable patterns that
hostile agents exploit. "Less intelligent" strategies succeed more because they're
less predictable.

### Genuine Differentiation Achieved

Unlike the omniscient solver (tactical_07) where BF = AI = Hybrid (identical steps
across all 25 seeds), the fog-of-war version produces **measurably different** outcomes:
- Different exploration paths → different boss encounters → different survival rates
- Discovery order varies by strategy → different puzzle-solving sequences
- AI vs Hybrid disagree on 1 seed → marginal but non-zero differentiation

### Files

| File | Purpose |

| `examples/tactical_09_fog.rs` | Full TUI with fog rendering, 3-round flow |
| `examples/tactical_10_fog_bench.rs` | Headless benchmark across 30 seeds |

## Next Steps

1. ~~**Boss avoidance heuristics**~~ — ✅ Done (plan 113). Minimal adjacent-only dodge is optimal.
   Stronger avoidance (frontier penalties, path-level dodge) creates oscillation worse than death.
   AI now beats BF (6 vs 5 wins). See plan 113 for full research findings.
2. **Hybrid exploration loop fix** — Hybrid's cluster-based exploration gets stuck in loops
   on certain seeds (500-step timeouts). Potential fix: stuck detector that switches to BF
   nearest-frontier after N steps without progress. This is the next lever to pull for Hybrid.
3. **Larger map with rooms** — 16×16 with one bridge is too small. A multi-room map
   with multiple doors would create richer exploration decisions and more differentiation.
4. **Oracle tiles** — tiles that reveal information (e.g., "goal is to the south").
   AI reasons about when to visit oracles vs explore directly.
5. **Adaptive exploration** — AI that adjusts strategy based on what it's discovered
   so far (e.g., "found keys but no boxes → boxes must be behind bridge").
