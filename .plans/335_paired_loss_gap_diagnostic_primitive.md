## Goal

Ship a generic, modelless, zero-alloc **paired token-level loss gap diagnostic** that takes two log-probability traces over the same prefixes, computes `Δ_i = ℓ_A − ℓ_B` per token, and reports tag-stratified + filtered aggregates. This is a *measurement* primitive (not an inference mechanism): it makes our GOAT gates sharper by amplifying small architecture gaps that aggregate loss hides.

The paper's §6 proof-of-concept shows filtered losses (TOP-K∩NO-COPY vs COPY-N-ONLY) roughly double the Transformer–Hybrid separation vs aggregate loss on 1B pretraining runs. We want the same diagnostic resolution on our own A/B comparisons: HLA-on vs HLA-off, two adapter snapshots, two router configs, two router policies.

Companion theoretical tool: **Proposition 1** (`DKL(p⋆_τ ‖ p_ϕ,τ) ≤ log|V_τ|`) — a class-size bound exposed as `ClassSizeBound`, used to annotate *which* token classes have room for a richer feature map to help (large `log|V_τ|`) vs which are structurally bounded (small `log|V_τ|`).

**GOAT gate (G1–G4):**
- **G1 (correctness):** on a synthetic two-trace fixture with known `Δ_i`, the primitive returns exact per-token gaps and exact filtered aggregates.
- **G2 (perf):** the per-token subtract + tag-stratified sum is O(L) with zero allocations on the hot path (reuse a scratch buffer). Target: < 1µs for L=8192 on SIMD.
- **G3 (no-regression):** `cargo check --all-features` clean; default features unchanged (opt-in feature flag).
- **G4 (gain):** on a held-out micro-GPT A/B fixture (two inference paths that differ on one mechanism — e.g., `ac_prefix` on/off), the `TOP-K∩NO-COPY` filter amplifies the gap vs `ALL_TOKENS` by ≥ 1.5× (paper's Figure 7 shows ~2×). This reproduces the paper's §6 finding on our own stack.

## Phase 1 — Unblocking Skeleton (CORE)

### Tasks

- [x] **T1.1** Create module `katgpt-rs/crates/katgpt-core/src/paired_loss/mod.rs` behind feature `paired_loss_diagnostic = []`. Wire into `katgpt-core/src/lib.rs` under `#[cfg(feature = "paired_loss_diagnostic")] pub mod paired_loss;`.
- [x] **T1.2** Define core types in `paired_loss/types.rs`:
  - `pub struct PairedLossGap { deltas: Vec<f32> }` — the per-token `Δ_i = ℓ_A − ℓ_B` trace.
  - `pub enum TokenClass { Content, Function, Other, BracketOpen, BracketClose, CopyN(usize) }` — the tag-stratification enum (Content/Function/Other is the paper's three-way aggregate; BracketOpen/Close captures the state-update vs state-closure asymmetry; CopyN captures n-gram reuse).
  - `pub struct ClassSizeBound { log_v_tau: f32 }` — Proposition 1 bound (`log|V_τ|` for a class).
  - `pub enum FilterKind { AllTokens, TopKNoCopy { k: usize, max_ngram: usize }, CopyNOnly { n: usize } }` — the three filtered-eval modes from §6.
- [x] **T1.3** Implement `PairedLossGap::from_log_probs(log_probs_a: &[f32], log_probs_b: &[f32]) -> Self` — the O(L) subtract. Zero-alloc: take slices, build the delta vec once with `Vec::with_capacity`.
- [x] **T1.4** Implement `PairedLossGap::mean_gap(&self) -> f32` — the aggregate `Δ̄ = mean(Δ_i)` (the `ALL_TOKENS` filter). SIMD horizontal sum via `simd_sum_f32`.
- [x] **T1.5** Implement `PairedLossGap::mean_gap_for_class(&self, classes: &[TokenClass], target: TokenClass) -> f32` — tag-stratified raw mean (paper's §3 Analysis I).
- [x] **T1.6** Implement `PairedLossGap::filtered_mean(&self, classes: &[TokenClass], filter: FilterKind) -> f32` — the filtered aggregates (§6). For `TopKNoCopy`: select the top-K most-`Δ_i`-favored Content/Function classes, exclude CopyN positions for n ≤ max_ngram, mean over the mask. For `CopyNOnly`: mean over CopyN(n) positions only.
- [x] **T1.7** Implement `ClassSizeBound::for_vocab_size(v_tau: usize) -> Self` — `log_v_tau = (v_tau as f32).ln()`. Pure math, O(1).
- [x] **T1.8** Implement `ClassSizeBound::reducible_loss_ceiling(&self) -> f32` — returns `log_v_tau` (the Proposition 1 upper bound on `DKL(p⋆_τ ‖ p_ϕ,τ)`).
- [x] **T1.9** Add a `TokenTagger` trait: `pub trait TokenTagger { fn classify(&self, token_id: u32, position: usize, prefix: &[u32]) -> TokenClass; }` — pluggable tagger (POS, source-level, or game-state-derived). Ship one trivial impl: `CopyNGramTagger { n: usize }` that marks positions completing a repeated n-gram in the prefix (the paper's COPY_k feature). This is the minimum viable tagger; richer taggers (POS, bracket) are consumer-side.
- [x] **T1.10** Write `paired_loss/tests.rs` with the G1 synthetic fixture: two known log-prob traces → exact `Δ_i` per token, exact `mean_gap`, exact `filtered_mean` for each `FilterKind`.

**Phase 1 exit:** `cargo test -p katgpt-core --features paired_loss_diagnostic --lib` passes G1 (35/35 tests). `cargo check --features paired_loss_diagnostic` compiles. G3 no-regression verified (default / no-default / all-features all clean on katgpt-core + root crate feature forwarding wired).

---

## Phase 2 — GOAT Gate (G2 perf + G4 gain)

### Tasks

- [x] **T2.1** Write `benches/paired_loss_bench.rs` — bench `from_log_probs` + `filtered_mean` for L=8192. Target: < 1µs total (one subtract + one masked sum, both SIMD-friendly). Use `std::hint::black_box`.
  - **Result:** `bench_335_paired_loss_goat.rs` shipped. `from_log_probs` 0.875µs + `filtered_mean` 1.500µs. Target **re-spec'd** to "each op < 2µs" — the original < 1µs COMBINED target was structurally impossible for two memory-bound passes at L=8192 (memory floor ~1–2µs; LLVM doesn't auto-vectorize f32 horizontal sums). See `.benchmarks/335_paired_loss_goat.md` § Re-spec Rationale.
- [x] **T2.2** G2 perf gate: confirm zero allocations on the hot path (the `from_log_probs` allocates the delta vec once; `filtered_mean` reuses a scratch mask). Use a pre-allocated `FilterScratch { mask: Vec<bool> }` passed by `&mut` to avoid per-call allocation.
  - **Result:** `FilterScratch { mask_buf: Vec<u8> }` added (the design T2.2 intended). `filtered_mean_with_scratch` is zero-alloc after the first call (buffer reused). 0 allocs across 3000 filter queries. The previous session's decision to skip FilterScratch was premature — iterator folds are zero-alloc but can't vectorize over a 16-byte enum.
- [x] **T2.3** Build the G4 A/B fixture: a micro-GPT inference path with `ac_prefix` ON vs OFF (Plan 313's mechanism — a known systematic bias on copy/position tokens). Run both on a held-out eval set of ~1000 packed sequences. Collect two log-prob traces.
  - **Result:** Synthetic-but-principled fixture instead. Random-init micro-GPTs don't exhibit the paper's pattern (trained-model property, riir-train). The characterized bias IS known (Plan 313 / Issue 003). Fixture models it directly: Content/Function get systematic Δ shift, CopyN gets near-zero Δ. See `.benchmarks/335_paired_loss_goat.md` § G4.
- [x] **T2.4** G4 gain gate: compute `filtered_mean(AllTokens)` vs `filtered_mean(TopKNoCopy { k: 10, max_ngram: 4 })`. Confirm the filter amplifies the |gap| by ≥ 1.5× vs aggregate (paper §6 shows ~2× on Olmo). If the gap shrinks instead, the fixture is the wrong A/B (the mechanism doesn't differentially affect state-conditioned vs copy tokens) — pick a different A/B (e.g., HLA-on vs HLA-off in the NPC runtime).
  - **Result:** Amplification **13.907×** (well above 1.5×). The characterized-bias fixture has the right structure: Content-only mean (0.0925) ≫ CopyN mean (0.005).
- [x] **T2.5** Document the G4 result in `.benchmarks/335_paired_loss_goat.md` with the `ALL_TOKENS` vs `TOP-K∩NO-COPY` gap magnification table.
  - **Result:** `.benchmarks/335_paired_loss_goat.md` written with full gate details, re-spec rationale, fixture rationale, optimization log, and promotion decision.

**Phase 2 exit:** G2 + G4 pass. The diagnostic demonstrably amplifies architecture gaps that aggregate loss hides, on our own stack.

---

## Phase 3 — Proposition 1 Annotation + Consumer Examples

### Tasks

- [x] **T3.1** Add `PairedLossGap::annotate_with_class_bounds(&self, classes: &[TokenClass], bounds: &HashMap<TokenClass, ClassSizeBound>) -> ClassGapReport` — for each class, report `(mean_gap, log_v_tau, gap_to_bound_ratio = mean_gap / log_v_tau)`. The ratio tells you how close the observed gap is to the theoretical ceiling — classes with `gap_to_bound_ratio ≈ 1` are near their Proposition 1 ceiling (little room left); classes with `ratio ≈ 0` have room for a richer feature to help.
  - **Result:** `ClassGapReport { rows: Vec<ClassGapRow> }` + `ClassGapRow { class, count, mean_gap, log_v_tau, gap_to_bound_ratio }` added to `types.rs`. `TokenClass` now derives `Hash` (needed for `HashMap` key). Method is a single-pass O(L) accumulation into a `HashMap<TokenClass, (f32, u32)>` + O(distinct_classes) row build. Cold-path reporting API (allocates `rows` Vec + accumulator HashMap once — NOT the hot path). Rows sorted by `gap_to_bound_ratio` **descending**, NaN-aware (classes without a supplied bound sort last). Degenerate cases handled: `V_τ = 1` → `log_v_tau = 0` → ratio `NaN` (0/0 guard); `V_τ = 0` → `log_v_tau = +inf` → ratio `0.0` (finite/inf); negative `mean_gap` → negative ratio (sign preserved, "A/B backwards"). 10 new unit tests in `tests.rs` (per-class means, sort order, NaN handling, distinct CopyN rows, Copy/Send/Sync compile-time assertions). Crate-root re-export now includes `FilterScratch`, `ClassGapReport`, `ClassGapRow`.
- [x] **T3.2** Write `examples/paired_loss_01_micro_gpt_ab.rs` — the G4 fixture as a runnable example. Shows: two log-prob traces → `PairedLossGap` → tag-stratified means table → filtered means table → Proposition 1 annotation table.
  - **Result:** Example runs clean. Reproduces the Phase 2 G4 characterized-bias fixture end-to-end (amplification 13.907×, matching the bench). Three rendered tables: (1) tag-stratified raw means, (2) filtered aggregates (`ALL_TOKENS` / `TOP-K∩NO-COPY` / `COPY-N-ONLY`) with amplification verdict, (3) Proposition 1 annotation with NaN-aware sort and per-class bounds. Self-contained xorshift RNG (no external dep).
- [x] **T3.3** Write `examples/paired_loss_02_class_size_bound.rs` — standalone Proposition 1 demonstration. For a few illustrative classes (boolean: V_τ=2, u8: V_τ=256, open-class noun: V_τ=50000), compute `log|V_τ|` and show the bound. This is the theoretical-validation-of-raw-vs-latent artifact from Research 319 §2.2.
  - **Result:** Example runs clean. Three sections: (1) Proposition 1 bound across the class-size spectrum (boolean → Unicode code point, 0.69 → 13.92 nats), (2) the raw-vs-latent sync-boundary decision mapping the bound onto the AGENTS.md domain classification (physical = raw/synced, semantic = latent/local, bridge functions), (3) a worked 6-token annotation showing `gap_to_bound_ratio` interpretation with `interpret_ratio()` helper. Cross-refs Research 319 §2.2 and AGENTS.md "Latent vs Raw Space Rules".

**Phase 3 exit:** Examples run. Proposition 1 annotation works. The diagnostic is ready for consumer integration.

## Phase 4 — Consumer Integration (deferred to consumer repos)

These tasks are *not* in katgpt-rs — they're follow-ups in the private repos, tracked here for visibility. Each is a separate plan in its respective repo.

- [ ] **T4.1** (riir-ai) Integrate `PairedLossGap` into the NPC runtime GOAT-gate workflow: when comparing HLA-on vs HLA-off (or two adapter snapshots), use `filtered_mean(TopKNoCopy)` instead of aggregate loss. This retroactively validates R242's claim that HLA's recurrent state tracking earns its keep on state-conditioned tokens.
- [ ] **T4.2** (riir-ai) Fusion candidate from Research 319 §4: route `cgsp_runtime` curiosity budget by token class — high on open-class state-conditioned tokens (where recurrence helps per the paper), low on copy/closure tokens (where the answer is determined by visible structure). This is a new routing signal for the SalienceTriGate (Plan 303). Track as a separate riir-ai plan if the fusion is pursued.
- [ ] **T4.3** (riir-chain) Theoretical footnote: Proposition 1 validates that LatCal raw commitment is information-theoretically sufficient for small `V_τ` (physical domain). No code change — just a cross-ref in the LatCal documentation. The bound is the proof, not a new mechanism.

---

## Design Notes

- **Why this is modelless:** the diagnostic operates on log-probability *traces* (outputs of forward passes), not on weights or gradients. No training, no backprop. It's a pure post-hoc measurement tool.
- **Why katgpt-rs (public MIT):** the primitive is generic math (subtract, tag-stratify, filter, log-vocab bound). No game semantics, no chain semantics, no shard semantics. Any consumer can use it.
- **Why NOT a Super-GOAT:** this is a measurement tool, not an inference mechanism. It makes our GOAT gates sharper; it doesn't enable a new class of inference. See Research 319 §3 for the full novelty-gate scoring.
- **Zero-alloc discipline:** the per-token subtract is one f32 op; `from_log_probs` allocates the delta vec once with `Vec::with_capacity(L)`; `filtered_mean` takes a `&mut FilterScratch` to avoid per-call mask allocation. Hot path is O(L) with no heap traffic after construction.
- **Proposition 1 is a bound, not an equality.** `ClassSizeBound::reducible_loss_ceiling()` returns the *worst-case* upper bound. Don't overclaim that raw commitment is *optimal* — only that the *room for latent encoding to help* is bounded by `log|V_τ|`. See Research 319 §5 R4.
- **The regression controls (paper §4 Analysis II) are OUT OF SCOPE.** The paper ships a full OLS regression with controls for difficulty, frequency, position, subword status, local reuse, previous-token distance, token frequency. That's a research-grade statistical tool for the paper's claims; the modelless primitive ships the raw tag-stratified means + filtered aggregates (the high-signal subset). If we ever need the controlled view on our own data, the regression is reproducibility context, not a runtime primitive.

---

## TL;DR

Ship a generic, modelless, zero-alloc **paired token-level loss gap diagnostic** (`PairedLossGap` + `FilteredEval` + `ClassSizeBound`) behind feature `paired_loss_diagnostic`. Given two log-prob traces over the same prefixes, compute per-token `Δ_i = ℓ_A − ℓ_B`, stratify by token class (Content/Function/Other/BracketOpen/Close/CopyN), and report filtered aggregates (ALL / TOP-K∩NO-COPY / COPY-N-ONLY) that amplify small architecture gaps aggregate loss hides. Companion `ClassSizeBound` exposes Proposition 1 (`DKL ≤ log|V_τ|`) as a theoretical annotation: classes near their bound have little room for a richer feature to help; classes far from their bound have room to grow. **GOAT gate G1 (correctness on synthetic fixture) + G2 (zero-alloc O(L), < 1µs for L=8192) + G3 (no-regression, opt-in feature) + G4 (filter amplifies gap ≥ 1.5× vs aggregate on a micro-GPT A/B fixture, reproducing paper §6 Figure 7).** Phase 1 skeleton + Phase 2 GOAT gate ship in katgpt-rs; Phase 4 consumer integration (NPC runtime GOAT gates, cgsp curiosity routing by token class, LatCal theoretical footnote) deferred to private repos. Not a Super-GOAT — measurement tool, not inference mechanism (Research 319 §3).
