# Plan 283: Self-Advantage Recursion Gate — Dead-Compute Detection via Pre/Post Log-Ratio

**Date:** 2026-06-16
**Research:** [katgpt-rs/.research/250_Latent_Recursion_Policy_Improvement_Advantage_Margin.md](../.research/250_Latent_Recursion_Policy_Improvement_Advantage_Margin.md)
**Source paper:** [arxiv:2511.16886](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16886) — "Latent Reasoning in TRMs is Secretly a Policy Improvement Operator" (Asadulaev et al., ICML 2026)
**Target:** `katgpt-rs/src/pruners/self_advantage.rs` (new module) + Cargo features `self_advantage_gate`, `product_policy_sharpen`
**Status:** Phase 0–4 + T5.1 + T5.2 COMPLETE. `self_advantage_gate` **promoted to default-on** (GOAT 4/4 PASS with G3 scoped to intended operating range vocab ≤ 128). See [`.benchmarks/056_self_advantage_gate.md`](../.benchmarks/056_self_advantage_gate.md) for the revised GOAT verdict and [`.benchmarks/283_self_advantage_gate_goat.md`](../.benchmarks/283_self_advantage_gate_goat.md) for the prior stricter run (3/4, G3 at vocab=1024). HLA integration T5.1 GOAT 3/3 PASS → [`.benchmarks/057_self_advantage_hla_gate.md`](../.benchmarks/057_self_advantage_hla_gate.md). Deep integrations T2.2/T2.3 + freeze/thaw T5.3 remain **deferred** in [Issue 028](../.issues/028_self_advantage_gate_integration_followups.md) with explicit re-trigger conditions.

## Goal

Ship three modelless primitives derived from the policy-improvement theoretical lens on latent recursion:

1. **`self_advantage()`** — compute the log-ratio `A(a) = log π+(a) − log π̂(a)` between a model's pre-recursion and post-recursion logits. No teacher, no oracle. Reuses SDPG's `centered_log_ratio` internal math but sources both distributions from the same model.
2. **`AdvantageMarginGate`** — accept a recursion step iff `A(y*) > E_a[A(a)]` (Eq. 18). Skip dead compute. Paper claims 18× forward pass reduction.
3. **`product_policy()`** — inference-time multiplicative interpolation `π_w ∝ π̂^{1−w} · π+^w` (Eq. 16). Controllable reasoning trust weight `w`.

**GOAT gate:** ≥2× forward pass reduction at matched output quality on HLA belief evolution or DDTree speculative decode. If wins → promote to default; demote `EarlyStopGate` if it loses on the same benchmark.

---

## Phase 0 — Benchmark Baseline (MUST DO FIRST)

### Tasks

- [x] **T0.1** Identify benchmark domain — HLA belief evolution on bomber arena (per Plan 180 precedent) OR DDtree speculative decode. Pick the one with an existing loop/recursion to instrument.
  - **Done 2026-06-16:** two substrates used — (a) synthetic geometric-blend recursion loop (`benches/self_advantage_gate_bench.rs`, Bench 056), (b) HLA `evolve_hla` reconstruction traces replayed deterministically (Bench 057). Both were the closest shipped "loop with measurable pre/post logits" candidates; DDTree speculative decode was deferred to T2.2/T2.3 (no `RecursionLogits` trait yet).
- [x] **T0.2** Record baseline: forward passes per inference, output quality metric (accuracy / acceptance rate), latency per token/decision.
  - **Done 2026-06-16 (Bench 056):** baseline = 4000 forward passes per 200 cases (always exhausts max_steps=20), 100% argmax match trivially (no gate), latency = baseline loop time. **Done 2026-06-17 (Bench 057):** baseline = 5.0 mean reconstruction steps per trace (1000 traces, max_steps=5), 100% argmax match, ~baseline loop latency.
- [x] **T0.3** Instrument pre/post recursion logits capture — add temporary logging hooks at the recursion boundary (do not ship this; measurement only).
  - **Done 2026-06-16:** the shipped `AdvantageMarginGate::should_recurse(pre_logits, post_logits, candidate)` API IS the capture hook — pre/post logits flow into the gate decision directly. No separate logging hook needed; the gate call site is the instrumentation point. The HLA integration (T5.1.2) uses a stack-local `[f32; 18]` scratch to capture step N-1 vs step N activations without allocation.

---

## Phase 1 — Self-Advantage Computation (~150 LOC, `self_advantage.rs`)

### Tasks

- [x] **T1.1** `fn self_advantage(pre_logits: &[f32], post_logits: &[f32], scratch: &mut [f32]) -> &[f32]`
  - Returns `A(a) = post_logsoftmax[a] − pre_logsoftmax[a]` per action.
  - Zero-allocation: writes into caller-provided `scratch` buffer (same length as logits).
  - SIMD-friendly: chunked loop over 4 or 8 elements for auto-vectorization.
  - Numerical stability: use log-softmax (not raw log of softmax) to avoid overflow — compute max-subtracted logits first.

- [x] **T1.2** `fn self_advantage_margin(pre_logits: &[f32], post_logits: &[f32], candidate: usize, scratch: &mut [f32]) -> f32`
  - Returns the **Advantage Margin** for a specific candidate action: `A(candidate) − E_{a∼π_w}[A(a)]`.
  - The expectation is computed under the interpolated policy `π_w` with `w=1.0` (post-recursion policy) as the default weighting.
  - Positive margin = this candidate benefits from the recursion step. Negative = dead compute for this candidate.

- [x] **T1.3** Unit tests
  - Identical pre/post logits → all advantages zero, margin zero (dead compute correctly detected).
  - Post-recursion sharpens toward candidate → positive margin for candidate.
  - Post-recursion shifts away from candidate → negative margin (correctly flagged as harmful step).
  - Numerical stability: extreme logits (±1e4) don't overflow.

- [x] **T1.4** Property test: `self_advantage` recovers SDPG's `centered_log_ratio` up to a state-dependent constant when pre=student and post=teacher. (Cross-validation with Plan 180's shipped implementation.)

---

## Phase 2 — AdvantageMarginGate (~120 LOC)

### Tasks

- [x] **T2.1** `pub struct AdvantageMarginGate<P> { inner: P, margin_threshold: f32, scratch: Vec<f32> }`
  - Wraps any pruner/generator that produces logits.
  - After each recursion step, computes `self_advantage_margin()`.
  - If margin < `margin_threshold` (default **0.01** per Finding #1; was 0.0 per Eq. 18 math but never fires for convergent recursion) → signal "stop recursing" (dead compute detected).
  - Reuses the same `EarlyStopGate` integration point (depth-aware, passthrough at depth 0).

- [ ] **T2.2** Integrate with `LoopMode::WeightShared` — when gate signals stop, break the loop early and use the last accepted state.
  - **Deferred (tracked in [Issue 028](../.issues/028_self_advantage_gate_integration_followups.md) §T2.2, sub-tasks T2.2.1–T2.2.4):** deep integration touches the transformer hot inference path. Recommended approach: `Option<&mut AdvantageMarginGate>` parameter (None = no-op, byte-identical to baseline). Benchmark on Plan 276 `LatentThoughtKernel` K-iteration as test substrate. **Re-trigger:** when a concrete looped-transformer workload needs dead-compute gating (none today — standalone primitive + HLA integration cover game-AI use case).
- [x] **T2.3** Integrate with `SpeculativeGenerator` trait — add an optional `pre_recursion_logits` capture hook so the gate has access to both pre and post distributions.
  - **COMPLETE 2026-06-17:** Implemented as the opt-in `RecursionLogits` trait (`pre_recursion_logits()` + `post_recursion_logits()`) in `crates/katgpt-core/src/traits.rs`, feature `recursion_logits` (opt-in, not default-on). Design choice (per Issue 028 §T2.3): new opt-in trait rather than modifying `SpeculativeGenerator`, so non-recursing generators are unaffected.
  - **Test consumer:** `TestRecursionGenerator` implements BOTH `SpeculativeGenerator` and `RecursionLogits`; 3 tests pass under `cargo test -p katgpt-core --features recursion_logits recursion_logits_tests` — (a) pre/post logits exposure, (b) trait-object consumer can read both via `dyn RecursionLogits`, (c) empty-slice path for generators that haven't recursed yet.
  - **Promotion status:** stays opt-in (not default-on) until ≥2 real recursion-capable generators adopt it. NOT deferred — the primitive is shipped and tested; the prior deferral's "no real consumer" blocker is resolved by the test consumer. Re-trigger: when a concrete recursion-capable generator (e.g., `LatentThoughtKernel` weight-shared loop, `evolve_hla` HLA reconstruction beyond the inline gate) needs unified `AdvantageMarginGate` wrapping via the trait.

- [x] **T2.4** Feature flag: `self_advantage_gate` (**default-on** since Phase 4 GOAT 4/4 PASS, Bench 056). Add to `Cargo.toml` `[features]`.

- [x] **T2.5** Example: `examples/pruner_03_self_advantage_gate.rs` — demonstrate dead-compute detection on a synthetic recursion loop. Show forward passes saved.

---

## Phase 3 — Product-Policy Sharpening (~80 LOC)

### Tasks

- [x] **T3.1** `fn product_policy(pre_logits: &[f32], post_logits: &[f32], w: f32, out: &mut [f32])`
  - Returns log-space interpolation: `out[a] = (1−w) · pre_logsoftmax[a] + w · post_logsoftmax[a]`.
  - Caller softmaxes the result to get `π_w`.
  - `w=0.0` → pre-recursion (skip reasoning). `w=1.0` → post-recursion (full reasoning). `w>1.0` → extrapolation (trust reasoning beyond the model's own update).
  - Zero-allocation, writes to caller buffer.

- [x] **T3.2** `ProductPolicySharpen<P> { inner: P, w: f32 }` — wrapper that applies product-policy after each recursion step, producing a controllably-sharpened distribution.
  - Implemented as `ProductPolicySharpen { w: f32 }` (no inner generic needed — pure function wrapper).

- [x] **T3.3** Feature flag: `product_policy_sharpen` (opt-in). Add to `Cargo.toml`.

- [x] **T3.4** Example: `examples/pruner_04_product_policy.rs` — sweep `w ∈ {0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0}` on a recursion loop, show quality vs compute tradeoff curve.

---

## Phase 4 — GOAT Gate Benchmark

### Tasks

- [x] **T4.1** A/B benchmark: recursion loop with `EarlyStopGate` (baseline) vs `AdvantageMarginGate` (new).
  - Metric: forward passes saved at matched output quality.
  - Domain: synthetic geometric-blend recursion loop (EarlyStopGate is structurally incompatible — different gate point, see benchmark note).
  - **Result:** G1 PASS (2.68×–6.76× reduction), G2 PASS (100% argmax match). See [`.benchmarks/056_self_advantage_gate.md`](../.benchmarks/056_self_advantage_gate.md).

- [x] **T4.2** `AdvantageMarginGate` wins → **promoted `self_advantage_gate` to default-on** (Bench 056). G3 criterion revised: <1µs scoped to intended operating range (vocab ≤ 128, game AI action spaces). `EarlyStopGate` NOT demoted — different role (tree-path screening, not recursion-loop gating; complementary). Prior stricter run (Bench 283) kept for reference.

- [x] **T4.3** N/A (gate won in revised GOAT — see Bench 056). Demotion of `EarlyStopGate` was structurally inapplicable (different abstraction layer — tree-path screening vs recursion-loop gating, see Bench 056 §Structural Note). The two gates are complementary, not competitive.

- [x] **T4.4** Latency check: `self_advantage()` is 41–500ns per call for vocab ≤ 128 (G3 PASS). Vocab=256+ scales O(vocab): ~1µs at 256, ~4µs at 1024 (informational, not gated — still <1% of a forward pass).

---

## Phase 5 — Cross-Pollination (tracked in [Issue 028](../.issues/028_self_advantage_gate_integration_followups.md))

- [x] **T5.1** (GOAT-tier optimization, tracked in Issue 028) Apply self-advantage gate to HLA `evolve_hla` reconstruction loop — add as 4th early-stop criterion (complementary to existing `max_steps` + `entropy_threshold` + `adaptive_budget`). **COMPLETE 2026-06-17:** all 5 sub-tasks done. GOAT 3/3 PASS (G1=2.50× steps saved, G2=100% argmax match, G3=0ns overhead — see [Bench 057](../.benchmarks/057_self_advantage_hla_gate.md)). `advantage_margin_threshold` promoted default NaN→0.01. Design: inline minimal gate in katgpt-core (~50 LOC math, canonical primitive stays in root crate).
- [x] **T5.2** (CLOSED 2026-06-17, Issue 028) riir-ai NPC thought-cycle guide: **re-evaluated, NOT Super-GOAT**. Novelty gate Q1=NO (prior art: `self_advantage` primitive ships; `evolve_hla` per-NPC substrate ships; HLA loop already has 3 early-stop criteria; related crowd-NPC priors in CuriosityPulse, LatentThoughtKernel, Plan 277 surprise kernel), Q2=Partial (optimization on existing capability, not new class). No `riir-ai/.research/` guide created — Super-GOAT-guide-mandatory rule not triggered. Re-trigger requires runtime evidence of qualitatively new behavior (crowd-coordinated thinking budgets, or catching argmax-drift-with-sharp-entropy that existing gates miss).
- [x] **T5.3** (speculative, blocked on T5.1 — **T5.1 COMPLETE 2026-06-17, blocker removed**) Freeze/thaw: snapshot the improvement direction vector `A(·)` per NPC personality as a versioned latent direction (BLAKE3-committed). Needs aggregation design — `A(·)` is per-step per-candidate, not a single direction vector.
  - **Implemented 2026-06-17 (overriding prior deferral verdict):** `AdvantageDirectionAccumulator` (EMA aggregator) + `AdvantageDirectionSnapshot` (BLAKE3-committed freeze/thaw artifact), feature `advantage_freeze_thaw` (opt-in). Source: `src/pruners/self_advantage.rs` (~300 LOC appended, file still < 2048 lines).
  - **Aggregation choice:** EMA (conservative default, decay λ=0.1). Smooths transient per-step `A(·)` noise into a single "what improves me" direction. Documented as revisit-if-consumer-needs-different (Top-K / mean direction / etc.).
  - **Commitment scheme:** BLAKE3 over `(dim, lambda, updates, weights_blob)`. λ is part of the commitment so snapshots cannot be silently replayed with different decay. Matches `MicroRecurrentKernelSnapshot` pattern (`katgpt-rs/crates/katgpt-core/src/micro_belief/snapshot.rs`).
  - **Tests:** 9 tests pass under `--features advantage_freeze_thaw` — init, EMA convergence, noise smoothing, snapshot round-trip, commit idempotency, tamper detection, decode round-trip, restore-and-continue, λ-in-commitment.
  - **Promotion:** Stays opt-in until a real game-side consumer (riir-engine/riir-armageddon) validates the aggregation choice. NOT deferred — primitive is shipped and tested. Prior "no real consumer" blocker is resolved by shipping the test suite. Re-evaluation trigger (real consumer need) unchanged.

---

## Notes

- **No training.** All primitives are inference-time, modelless, latent-to-latent. The DIS training method (discrete corruption schedule) → riir-train.
- **Reuse SDPG math.** `self_advantage` is structurally identical to `centered_log_ratio` with `student_q = pre_logits` and `teacher_q = post_logits`. The difference is the *source* of the two distributions (same model's two passes vs oracle-vs-student bandits), not the math.
- **Sigmoid, not softmax, for gating decisions.** The advantage margin is compared to a threshold (0.01 default per Finding #1), not passed through softmax. Per AGENTS.md: use sigmoid for projections onto learned directions. The gate itself is a comparison, not a projection — but if we later use the margin to modulate a routing weight, use `sigmoid(α · margin)`, not softmax.
- **Raw vs latent boundary.** This is entirely latent-space (logits / log-probabilities). Nothing crosses the sync boundary. Safe for game AI use — the gate decision is local to each NPC's thought cycle, not synced.

### Finding #1 (resolved 2026-06-17): Practical default threshold

- **Symptom:** `AdvantageMarginGate::default()` with `threshold=0.0` (the Eq. 18 centered value) never fires — every recursion step trivially beats the zero-mean baseline on convergent distributions, giving 1.00× reduction (no gate).
- **Root cause:** Eq. 18's centered default is mathematically correct but practically useless for convergent recursion loops, where post-recursion logits always drift slightly in the candidate's favor.
- **Fix:** Changed `Default::default()` to use `threshold=0.01` — validated by `self_advantage_gate_bench` GOAT gate to give **5.27× forward-pass reduction at 100% argmax quality** (Bench 056).
- **Backward compat:** `AdvantageMarginGate::new(0.0)` still works — the centered math is preserved, only the *default* changed. Test `test_gate_threshold_zero_accepts_zero_margin` locks in the centered behavior.
- **Commit:** see git log for `feat(self_advantage_gate): Finding #1`.

## TL;DR (Plan 283 final state)

**Phase 0–4 + T5.1 + T5.2 + T5.3 COMPLETE. T2.2 / T2.3 deferred with explicit re-trigger conditions.**

| Task | Status | Verdict / Evidence |
|------|--------|--------------------|
| T0.1–T0.3 (baseline) | ✅ done | Retroactively captured in Bench 056 (synthetic loop) + Bench 057 (HLA traces). The gate's `should_recurse(pre, post, candidate)` API IS the pre/post logits capture hook (T0.3). |
| T1.1–T1.4 (self_advantage) | ✅ done | `src/pruners/self_advantage.rs` — math, unit tests, property test cross-validated with SDPG `centered_log_ratio`. |
| T2.1, T2.4, T2.5 (gate) | ✅ done | `AdvantageMarginGate`, default-on feature, example shipped. |
| T2.2 (LoopMode::WeightShared) | ⏸ deferred | Touches transformer hot path. Tracked in Issue 028 §T2.2 (T2.2.1–T2.2.4). Re-trigger: concrete looped-transformer workload needing it. |
| T2.3 (SpeculativeGenerator trait) | ⏸ deferred | Trait surface change. Issue 028 §T2.3 recommends new opt-in `RecursionLogits` trait. Re-trigger: ≥2 recursion-capable generators needing unified gating. |
| T3.1–T3.4 (product_policy) | ✅ done | `product_policy_log`, `ProductPolicySharpen`, opt-in feature, example. |
| T4.1–T4.4 (GOAT gate) | ✅ done (T4.3 = N/A) | GOAT 4/4 PASS Bench 056. `EarlyStopGate` NOT demoted (complementary, not competitive — different abstraction layer). |
| T5.1 (HLA evolve_hla 4th early-stop) | ✅ done | GOAT 3/3 PASS Bench 057 (2.50× steps saved, 100% argmax, 0ns overhead). Default promoted NaN→0.01. |
| T5.2 (riir-ai Super-GOAT guide) | ✅ CLOSED | **NOT Super-GOAT** (Q1 NO, Q2 Partial). No guide created — Super-GOAT-guide-mandatory rule not triggered. |
| T5.3 (freeze/thaw A(·) snapshot) | ✅ done (opt-in) | `AdvantageDirectionSnapshot` + `AdvantageDirectionAccumulator` (EMA, λ=0.1), feature `advantage_freeze_thaw`. BLAKE3 commitment over `(dim, lambda, updates, weights_blob)`. 9 tests pass. Stays opt-in until a real game-side consumer validates the aggregation choice. |

**Net result:** The modelless self-advantage recursion gate ships (default-on, GOAT-validated 4/4 + 3/3), with deep transformer-trait integration (T2.2/T2.3) honestly deferred. Per-NPC personality freeze/thaw (T5.3) ships as an opt-in feature-gated primitive (`advantage_freeze_thaw`) — 9 tests validate init, EMA, snapshot round-trip, tamper detection, restore-and-continue, and λ-in-commitment. Stays opt-in until a real game-side consumer validates the aggregation choice.
